{"title": "Trump vs Fauci:  President\u2019s gut sense collides with science", "articleDate": "March 21, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In a clash of gut instinct versus science, President Donald Trump and the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, are politely but publicly sparing over whether a malaria drug would work to treat people with coronavirus disease.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump is clinging to his feeling that a malaria drug widely available could be the answer-in-waiting to an outbreak spreading around the nation, shutting down major parts of the economy, and posing the biggest challenge he has faced as president. Calmly and quietly, Fauci insists that the science is not yet there to validate Trump\u2019s hope. Neither man directly challenged the other.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The extraordinary scene played out on national television both Friday and Saturday during White House briefings <a class=\"\" href=\"/d733b33f4337369947e348e0e7f63a1e\">on the outbreak</a><!-- -->. Anxious for answers, Americans heard conflicting views.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Reporters asked both men \u2014 first Fauci, then Trump \u2014 if a malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine could be used to prevent COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. A day earlier, when Fauci wasn\u2019t with him at that briefing, Trump had called attention to the drug.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Friday, Fauci took the reporter\u2019s question and got right to the point.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer ... is no.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe information that you\u2019re referring to specifically is anecdotal,\u201d Fauci added firmly. \u201cIt was not done in a controlled clinical trial, so you really can\u2019t make any definitive statement about it.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug \u2014 chloroquine \u2014 are sold around the world under a variety of brand and generic names. They can be prescribed off-label by doctors in the United States. They may interfere with the coronavirus being able to enter cells, and some scientists have reported possible encouraging signs in test-tube and other small studies.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fauci on Friday went on to explain that the Food and Drug Administration is looking for a way to make the drug available for emergency use, but in a manner that gives the government data about whether it\u2019s safe and effective. Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH and in more than 30 years has handled HIV, SARS, MERS, Ebola and now the new coronavirus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Currently, there is no medicine specifically approved for treating COVID-19.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Trump stuck to what his gut was telling him. As the two men took turns at the podium, Trump said he disagreed with the notion that there is no magic drug for the coronavirus disease. \u201cMaybe and maybe not, \u201d he said. \u201cMaybe there is, maybe there isn\u2019t. We have to see.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He struck an upbeat note, while trying not to directly challenge Fauci.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think without seeing too much, I\u2019m probably more of a fan of that,\u201d he said, referring to the malaria drug. \u201cAnd we all understand what the doctor said is 100% correct.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Then the president added, \u201cIt\u2019s a strong drug. So, we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That same mixed-message dynamic was on display during Saturday\u2019s White House briefing \u2014 this time with both men publicly acknowledging their clashing stances. Prior to the briefing Trump tweeted about a preliminary French study suggesting that hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, a common antibiotic, might be an effective treatment for COVID-19. During the briefing, Trump doubled down on his support for the malaria drug, saying it would be distributed for use while Fauci remained respectfully skeptical. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI feel, as the expression goes, what do we have to lose,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTony would like, he would like samples done in a certain way. I understand that, too. Many doctors agree with that. We don\u2019t have much time. We have a lot of very sick people right now.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fauci called the hydroxychloroquine evidence \u201canecdotal\u201d and made it clear that wasn\u2019t how the science works. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf you really want to definitively know if something works, you\u2019ve got to do the kind of trial where you get the good information,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fauci compared the current speculation to the early days of medical trial-and-error during the AIDS crisis when multiple anecdotal treatments were floated, \u201cuntil we finally developed drugs that were knockout drugs that were safe and that were effective.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fauci has a track record of being the fact-based counterpoint to the Trump administration\u2019s upbeat assessments of the coronavirus outbreak. For much longer than that, he\u2019s specialized in the same calm and persistent repetition of the information he thinks his audience \u2014 whether the public or physicians \u2014 needs to know.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Weeks ago, after Fauci said that even with all deliberate speed a vaccine could take a year to 18 months, Trump told a political rally one could be ready \u201crelatively soon.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As administration officials repeatedly assured the public that coronavirus tests were rapidly becoming available, Fauci at a congressional hearing said the lack of widespread testing was \u201ca failing\u201d of the system. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Although Fauci has publicly supported Trump\u2019s travel restrictions to try to keep the virus out, he warned the worst was coming even as Trump suggested the crisis was under good control.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Saturday, with his public dissonance with the president now becoming a regular feature of the White House briefings, Fauci worked to find some sort of middle ground.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe president is talking about hope for people and it\u2019s not an unreasonable thing,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do my job as a scientist and others have other things to do.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writers Nancy Benac, Lauran Neergaard, Ashraf Khalil and Lindsey Tanner contributed to this report.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

{"title": "Imports of medical supplies plummet as demand in US soars", "articleDate": "March 21, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By MARTHA MENDOZA and JULIET LINDERMAN", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The critical shortage of medical supplies across the U.S., including testing swabs, protective masks, surgical gowns and hand sanitizer, can be tied to a sudden drop in imports, mostly from China, The Associated Press has found.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trade data shows the decline in shipments started in mid-February after the spiraling coronavirus outbreak in China led the country to shutter factories and disrupted ports. Some emergency rooms, hospitals and clinics in the U.S. have now run out of key medical supplies, while others are rationing personal protective equipment like gloves and masks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The United States counts on receiving the vast majority of its medical supplies from China, where the coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people and killed more than 3,200. When Chinese medical supply factories began coming back on line last month, their first priority was their own hospitals. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The government required makers of N95 masks to sell all or part of their production internally instead of shipping masks to the U.S. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The most recent delivery of medical-grade N95 masks arrived from China about a month ago, on Feb. 19. And as few as 13 shipments of non-medical N95 masks have arrived in the past month \u2014 half as many as arrived the same month last year. N95 masks are used in industrial settings, as well as hospitals, and filter out 95% of all airborne particles, including ones too tiny to be blocked by regular masks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Governors across the country are becoming panicked as states run out of equipment. President Donald Trump has urged them to buy masks on the open market, but few if any are available.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWithout adequate protection, more of our hospital staff could become ill, which would mean there wouldn\u2019t be people to care for patients,\u201d said Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association\u2019s vice president of quality and patient safety policy. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some hospitals are down to just a day or two of personal protective equipment, she said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The AP found that in the past month, hand sanitizer and swab imports both dropped by 40%, N95 mask imports were down 55%, and surgical gowns, typically sourced from China, were at near normal levels because the sourcing was shifted to Honduras.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Typically, medical supplies are delivered along both coasts. But almost all the supplies that did arrive in the past month came into Newark, New Jersey, across the country from the earliest and most severe coronavirus outbreaks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The AP identified the falling imports by looking at shipment data maintained by ImportGenius and Panjiva Inc., services that independently track global trade.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In mid-February, the World Health Organization warned that global demand for safety gear for medical providers was 100 times higher than normal. Prices were 20 times higher, stockpiles were depleted and there was a four- to six-month backlog. Despite this, federal contracting data shows there was no big effort at that point to submit orders.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trade policies haven\u2019t helped. Tariffs on medical supplies made them more expensive, and they were only lifted March 5, even though health care associations asked the administration last year to exempt items like masks, gloves and gowns. And now countries including South Korea, India and Taiwan are blocking exports of medical supplies to save them for their own citizens, leaving the U.S. with fewer options. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe lag time could be weeks. It could be upward of months,\u201d said Khatereh Calleja, CEO of the Healthcare Supply Chain Association. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Doctors, nurses and first responders in the U.S. are resorting to spraying their masks with bleach at the end of each day and hanging them up at home to dry to use for another day, according to the American College of Emergency Physicians.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThere is a little bit of anxiety, as you can imagine, going to work and not knowing if you will have enough personal protective equipment,\u201d said Dr. David Tan, president of the National Association of EMS Physicians.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The decline in swabs included multiple varieties, not just ones needed to test for COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has for weeks warned state and local health departments about shortages of swabs, which are needed for the testing that is critical to containing the pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Even over-the-counter medical shipments are decreasing. Ten shipping containers filled with medical thermometers arrived at U.S. ports a year ago this month. But in the last 30 days, there were just five. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hand sanitizer, also commonly sourced from China, has disappeared from U.S. stores, and it may stay scarce. Last year by this time, 223 shipments had arrived. This year, since January, just 157 shipments have come.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The shortages affect patients because they can\u2019t get tested and their providers may be carrying the virus from one person to the next. But the far greater risk is to medical personnel: Already, there are reports of dozens of doctors, nurses and medical staff who have contracted the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nurses across the country report that they are not receiving the proper personal protective equipment and their hospitals don\u2019t have the isolation rooms they need to safely care for COVID-19 patients, according to National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s not safe at all. Nobody is safe,\u201d said Consuelo Vargas, an emergency room nurse at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. On Friday morning, after a possible exposure at work, she went to a local hardware store and bought all the painter booties and jumpsuits they had to wear while caring for people. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating because we feel like health care workers are being asked for a lot \u2014 and that\u2019s fine, we can do our job. We\u2019re just asking for the equipment we need,\u201d she said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The shortage doesn\u2019t affect only health care. The humanitarian medical firm Direct Relief thought it was heading into 2020 well-stocked, with several million N95 masks. The organization had increased its orders in 2019 after massive wildfires in the West filled cities with smoke, squeezing its supplies in recent years.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But then bushfires overwhelmed Australia with smoky skies and so Direct Relief began sending the masks there, vice president Tony Morain said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">When the coronavirus hit China, the organization began shipping the masks to Wuhan \u2014 the outbreak\u2019s epicenter \u2014 in an effort to contain the disease. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Morain said they\u2019ve ordered 2 million more masks and are awaiting the shipments. Those typically take at least five weeks to arrive: two weeks to make the masks, two weeks of shipping and a week to get through the port. Meanwhile, he said, Direct Relief has received well over 100 requests from hospitals and health centers down to their last boxes.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In an effort to fill the gap, Minnesota-based 3M is running its Aberdeen, South Dakota, plant around the clock, producing millions of N95 masks per month. The company is also ramping up production of surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions, CEO Mike Roman said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nonetheless, one federal contract with 3M for $4.8 million of N95 masks dated March 12 says the masks will be delivered April 30 \u2014 seven weeks later, according to public contract data. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A number of Chinese companies told the AP this week that they will be resuming exports \u2014 which bring higher prices \u2014 but that they are overwhelmed and can\u2019t meet demand. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cChinese mask manufacturers have received too many orders from abroad, but have no time to produce all of them and make a delivery,\u201d said David Peng, manager of Ningbo Buy Best International Trading Co. Ltd.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trade data shows importers have managed to maintain some supplies by shifting to factories outside China. Shipments of surgical gowns, for example, have dropped less than 5% since December, since they are now coming from Honduras. The same is true for medical gloves, which are now primarily coming from South Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The federal government said a national stockpile was being made available at the state level, but governors said they weren\u2019t getting what they need.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think every governor in the United States has been banging on the door of the federal government with respect to the stockpile. We certainly have, and we\u2019re going to continue to,\u201d Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said at a news conference this week.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California-San Francisco, said he was alarmed by new CDC advice for hospitals that run out of masks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cFor the CDC to say people can wear bandanas is actually quite frightening,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought the CDC would say something like that. We\u2019re in the United States of America in 2020, and we have a recommendation to use bandanas?\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing, reporter Steve LeBlanc in Boston, reporter Michael Biesecker in Washington and data editor Meghan Hoyer contributed to this story.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Contact the AP\u2019s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

{"title": "Election limbo as coronavirus outbreak upends US primaries", "articleDate": "March 21, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By CHRISTINA A. CASSIDY", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 U.S. elections have been upended by the <a class=\"\" href=\"/VirusOutbreak\">coronavirus</a><!-- --> pandemic. At least 13 states have postponed voting and more delays are possible as health officials warn that social distancing and other measures to contain the virus might be in place for weeks, if not months.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The states that have yet to hold their primaries find themselves in a seemingly impossible situation as they look to balance public health concerns with the need to hold elections. While election officials routinely prepare for natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, the virus outbreak poses a unique challenge. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cUsually when we are dealing with a crisis in elections, it\u2019s something that happens and then it\u2019s done,\u201d said Chris Harvey, Georgia\u2019s director of elections. \u201cThe difference now is that it\u2019s a spreading threat, a fast-growing threat. We don\u2019t know where, when or how it is going to end.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Primaries scheduled for Georgia, Ohio, Maryland, Indiana, Louisiana, Connecticut and Kentucky have all been postponed to May or June. The Rhode Island Board of Elections has recommended the primary be delayed to June, while officials in Wisconsin are debating what to do.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has insisted the April 7 primary be held as scheduled, but a state elections commissioner said this past week that doing so would put people at risk. The state\u2019s chief elections official cited a host of problems Wisconsin could face if it moved forward with the election: a poll worker shortage, lack of polling places and potential disruption of absentee voting if mail service in the U.S. were to shut down.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">All this comes at the worst possible time for election officials, in the middle of a major election year. The virus outbreak erupted halfway through the presidential primary season. Voters in 23 states have yet to cast their ballots. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While Arizona, Florida and Illinois held their elections as scheduled last Tuesday, Ohio halted voting over public health concerns after federal officials encouraged people over age 65 to stay home.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe cannot tell people to stay inside, but also tell them to go out and vote,\u201d Gov. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said on Twitter, in announcing plans to delay.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The states that have opted to press ahead have found themselves dealing with what one Chicago elections official called a \u201ctsunami\u201d of cancellations by poll workers, who tend to be older, and a last-minute scramble to relocate polling places away from nursing homes and senior living communities. Severe illness and death associated with coronavirus has been most common in people 65 and older, especially those who have heart disease or other chronic conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In addition to the presidential race, dozens of congressional and local primaries are in limbo. Primaries play an important role in deciding which party candidates will appear on the ballot for the November general election. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Runoff elections in Alabama, Texas and Mississippi were also delayed, as were local elections in Oklahoma, Missouri and New Jersey. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There\u2019s no indication May or June will be any better to hold elections, but officials say postponing voting even for a few weeks gives them an opportunity to put in place plans to keep the public safe while voting. This includes moving polling places, recruiting backup poll workers and acquiring enough cleaning supplies for voting sites.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAt some point, we have to execute an election,\u201d Harvey said, adding Georgia planned a major push to expand absentee voting for the May primary.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There have been calls, including from Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, for elections to be held mostly by mail. But making this switch will be difficult for some and impossible for others. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In several states, it would take legislation or even a constitutional amendment to allow. Even then, election experts say there would be costs and logistical hurdles. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For instance, states would have to decide whether taxpayers or individual voters would be responsible for return postage. It would require new machines and software in many places to track ballots in the mail and process and count them when they\u2019re returned. All of that could cost billions of dollars, at a time when state revenues are likely to drop amid increased unemployment and decreased tax collections. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Further, advocates say not all voters can fill out ballots by hand and that sending ballots could miss some voters, such as Native Americans who live on reservations where mail isn\u2019t delivered to every home.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Meanwhile, steps taken \u2014 or not taken \u2014 to change aspects of the voting process are being met with lawsuits from political parties and voting rights advocates. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Ohio, voting rights groups are suing the state for refusing to reopen the voter registration window for the state primary, now scheduled for June 2. Under Ohio law, voters can register up to 30 days before an election. Advocates say the other states with postponed primaries are allowing voter registration ahead of rescheduled elections. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Wisconsin, the Democratic Party has sued to force the state to make it easier to register to vote and request an absentee ballot. They also have asked for mailed ballots to count if they are postmarked by Election Day and received within 10 days after voting.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Any increase in absentee voting will surely add to the workload for election offices already stretched thin and navigating recommendations that people work from home.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The elections office in Cobb County, Georgia, has sent home most of its temporary and seasonal employees brought on to help prep for elections. That means more work for the full-time employees who remain, as they are already seeing an increase in applications for absentee ballots. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAs we prepare for May, there is still so much to do,\u201d said Janine Eveler, elections director for the metro Atlanta county. \u201cMany of us are here when we would like to be home with our families because it\u2019s scary right now.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Looming over the scramble over the primaries are worries about the general election in November, a date that is set by federal law. Federal legislation has been proposed that would have all voters receive a mail-in ballot for the November election and provide federal funds to help states cover the costs.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU\u2019s School of Law is calling for task forces in every state to implement plans for executing an election amid a pandemic and urging Congress to provide money to help states. They estimate their proposals, including universal mail-in voting, could cost up to $2 billion.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThings will need to change,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, head of the center\u2019s democracy program. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three weeks to six weeks to recover.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed to this report. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

{"title": "Trump\u2019s big promises on COVID-19 often fall short", "articleDate": "March 21, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By DEB RIECHMANN", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s become a fixture of life under quarantine. Almost daily, President Donald Trump appears on television, flanked by officials, to announce his latest maneuver in the fight against the new coronavirus. He typically unveils a dramatic-sounding emergency measure, a solution that appears imminent or a bold promise meant to reassure Americans that he\u2019s got this. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Often, the reality falls short of the promise. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The new national testing infrastructure he unveiled in the Rose Garden last week is actually a modest pilot program still in development. The drug he branded a possible \u201cgame-changer\u201d still needs testing. It\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019s using all his power to ramp up production of medical equipment \u2014 or whether he\u2019s just preparing to do so. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s most high-profile announcements and how they line up with reality.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE PROMISE: Trump has said that 1.4 million tests would be available by next week and 5 million by mid-April. \u201cI doubt we\u2019ll need anywhere near that,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE RESULT: For more than two weeks administration officials have talked about shipping millions of tests to U.S. labs. But it\u2019s become clear those numbers have little bearing on the actual number of patients tested since most U.S. labs can process fewer than 100 patient samples per day. Last week, the FDA approved the first coronavirus tests for \u201chigh-volume\u201d laboratory systems, which are capable of processing thousands per day. That\u2019s expected to quickly increase U.S. testing capacity. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Efforts to tally U.S. testing numbers have been stymied by the fragmented nature of the country\u2019s health system, involving federal, state and local efforts and the private sector.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">This week, members of Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force gave the most comprehensive figures on testing yet. They estimated that about 60,000 people in the U.S. have been screened for the virus since January, split roughly between government and industry labs. But they acknowledged that those figures don\u2019t yet reflect numbers from hospitals.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE PROMISE: Under pressure to simplify the testing process, Trump last week declared that Google would jump in to help. \u201cGoogle is helping to develop a website,\u201d Trump told reporters gathered in the Rose Garden. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very quickly done ... to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump previewed a nationwide network of drive-thru testing sites at chains like Walmart and Target linked by the \u201cGoogle-facilitated\u201d website. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE RESULT: It quickly became clear that the seamless online network Trump described will not be available immediately. Verily, a subsidiary of Google, issued a statement clarifying that its website was in the early stages of development and initially would serve just the San Francisco area.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Google followed up with a statement that it would launch a national website to provide \u201ceducation, prevention, and local resources nationwide\u201d on COVID-19. A Google spokesman said Thursday the company was still working to \u201croll out a website later this week.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The White House plan has now changed to focus on community-based testing centers that would be staffed by state and federal emergency personnel.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE PROMISE: On Thursday, Trump offered an upbeat promotion of therapeutic drugs in early testing that he said could be \u201ca game-changer\u201d in treating those suffering. Trump said a common malaria drug called chloroquine had shown \u201cvery encouraging early results\u201d against coronavirus. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE RESULTS: Minutes later, from the same podium, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn tamped down Trump\u2019s enthusiasm. The drug wasn\u2019t approved for treatment of the coronavirus. His agency would be taking a closer look to see if it could benefit those patients. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial -- a large, pragmatic clinical trial -- to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be asked and answered,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That process takes months and might or might not yield any results. The FDA later issued a statement further clarifying that there are \u201cno FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, also noted that data needs to be collected and analyzed to prove that it is effective and safe against the coronavirus. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic drug out there,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump defended his optimism about the drug on Friday, saying it might or might not work, but said there was no reason not to try it. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">____</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The PROMISE: Trump said the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services will have the authority to waive laws and regulations on such things as telemedicine and licensing requirements for doctors operating across state lines to provide the medical community with greater flexibility to respond to the pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE RESULTS: Following the emergency declaration of March 13, HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued directives that, among other steps:</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u2014Expanded the use of telemedicine for Medicare patients.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u2014Waived license requirements so that doctors from one state can work in others with the greatest needs.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u2014Waived Medicare requirements of a three-day hospital stay before a patient can be admitted to a nursing home.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u2014Waived requirements that critical-access hospitals limit the number of beds to 25 and the length of stay to 96 hours. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Health care is one of the most heavily regulated areas of the economy, and that\u2019s done both to protect patients and safeguard federal dollars. But in a national emergency, some of those rules can get in the way, driving the system toward a breaking point. The temporary waivers of federal regulations allow hospitals to allocate scarce resources more efficiently in the face of rapidly changing circumstances. The telemedicine provisions, if seniors take advantage of them, could reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus for millions of people. The waivers were sought by the health care industry, and AARP was a leading proponent of the telemedicine option. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE PROMISE: Trump said last week he would suspend entry into the United States by foreign nationals who had been to Europe during the past 14 days. \u201cCitizens, permanent residents and our families \u2014 and even families returning from Europe \u2014 will be subject to extra screening\u201d and self-isolation for 14 days. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE RESULT: The administration\u2019s ban went into effect over the weekend for Europe and then on Monday for Britain and Ireland. But at the 13 airports where American citizens and green card holders returning from overseas were routed, the result initially was hours-long delays and throngs of travelers crammed together in tight spaces, the opposite of social distancing. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It\u2019s not clear yet whether any of those people had the illness or passed it on while they were trapped waiting for screening and clearance. It\u2019s also unclear whether anyone is adhering to the self-quarantine, because there is no way to track it. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE PROMISE: Trump said on Wednesday that he invoked the Defense Production Act, a 70-year-old authority to give the government more power to steer private companies to produce equipment, such as masks, ventilators and other supplies, needed to combat the virus. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE RESULTS: By the end of Friday, it was unclear if he had actually used the act to trigger production of the medical equipment. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Thursday, he tweeted that he had signed the act \u201cshould we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. ... Hopefully there will be no need.\u201d On Friday, he said he had put the Defense Production Act \u201cin gear\u201d but then added \u201cyou know, so far, we haven\u2019t had to\u201d use it because companies are volunteering.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he implored Trump during a phone call earlier Friday to use the Korean War-era act immediately to order the manufacture of ventilators and other critically needed medical equipment. The president told Schumer he would, then could be heard on the telephone seeming to make the order. He yelled to someone in his office to do it now, said Schumer\u2019s spokesman, Justin Goodman.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writers Matt Perrone, Colleen Long and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.</p>"]}

Most strikingly, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, <a class=\"\" href=\"/432a37435f28015e8b45eeff710cd254\">spoke forcefully</a><!-- --> to dampen expectations that a drug to treat COVID-19 was at hand, as the president had repeatedly suggested.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A review of some of the rhetoric:</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">TRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately, and that\u2019s where the FDA has been so great.

It\u2019s been approved.\u201d \u2014 briefing Thursday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE FACTS: It\u2019s not true that a new drug has been approved and is about ready to ship out.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The drug in question, known chemically as chloroquine, has been available for decades to treat the mosquito-borne illness malaria. Technically, doctors can already prescribe the drug to patients with COVID-19, a practice known as off-label prescribing. But Trump falsely suggested that the FDA had just cleared the drug specifically for the viral pandemic. That would mean that the drug had met the FDA\u2019s standards for safety and effectiveness.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Minutes later, the FDA commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, emphasized that the drug still needs testing to determine whether it can help patients. He said chloroquine would have to be tested in \u201ca large pragmatic clinical trial to actually gather that information.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Drug trials typically require hundreds or thousands of patients and, even when accelerated, take weeks or months to complete. In his remarks, Hahn warned against giving patients \u201cfalse hope\u201d before drugs are fully vetted.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While chloroquine has shown promise in preliminary laboratory studies, some experts are skeptical it will prove effective in human testing.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think it could be a game changer, and maybe not,\u201d Trump said, discussing the drug.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But the FDA reiterated in a statement hours after Trump\u2019s remarks that there are \u201cno FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">TRUMP: \u201cIf chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine works, or any of the other things that they\u2019re looking at that are not quite as far out ... your numbers are going to come down very rapidly.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THE FACTS: The drugs he is referring to are for treatment in patients already infected. That doesn\u2019t prevent spread of the virus. One study is testing chloroquine to try to protect health care workers at highest risk of infection, because a vaccine is probably a year or more away.

All while the global pandemic and its <a class=\"\" href=\"/b64cf00f37d8da2fad3533aa7686c53d\">nationwide shutdown</a><!-- --> grip an anxious, isolated population bracing for a healthcare crisis and looming recession. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">When one reporter asked Trump what he would tell a worried nation, the president snapped, \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Despite the enormous pressure on Washington to swiftly act, the challenges are apparent. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers and administration officials labored late into the evening over eye-popping sums and striking federal interventions, surpassing even the 2008-09 bank bailout and stimulus. They\u2019ll be back at it Saturday morning. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cEverybody is working very hard,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, exiting one closed-door session and heading into another. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While key negotiators said they made progress during the daylong talks, they failed to hit an end-of-day deadline to strike a deal. Talks broke around 10:30 p.m.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Mnuchin launched negotiations with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and senators from both parties using McConnell\u2019s GOP offer as a starting point.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cOur nation needs a major next step, and we need it fast,\u201d McConnell said earlier in the day to an empty chamber, the iconic U.S. Capitol closed to visitors. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Preliminary Senate votes are set for Sunday. McConnell said the goal is passage by Monday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Mnuchin also conferred privately Friday with Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the two leaders pressed for Democratic priorities. Pelosi late Friday called the GOP plan a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At one point, Schumer told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re making good progress.\u201d But Schumer acknowledged trying to wrap up \u201ctonight is hard.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The GOP plan aims to pump billions into $1,200 direct checks to Americans and billions to small businesses to pay idled workers during the global pandemic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Democrats say McConnell\u2019s plan is insufficient, arguing for greater income support for workers and a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for the U.S. healthcare industry, which is preparing for an onslaught of newly sick patients. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the White House, Trump welcomed the stimulus plan, believing it is needed to stabilize the economy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Trump spent much of Friday\u2019s daily briefing in a fury, an angry president lashing out at reporters\u2019 questions. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At times, he seemed to refuse to want to hear the reality of an increasingly dire situation. It was when one reporter noted the hard facts in the U.S. \u2014 that more than 200 are dead, more than 14,000 infected and millions scared \u2014 that he snapped back.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump also sowed further confusion about whether he is using the powers of the Defense Production Act to force American businesses to manufacture needed medical supplies.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Friday phone calls with Trump, Schumer said he specifically implored the president to invoke the Korean War-era act to ramp up production of desperately needed ventilators and other gear. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump told the Democratic leader he would do it \u2014 and then Schumer said the president could be heard yelling to someone in his office \u201cget it done.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Trump told reporters he had put the order he invoked Wednesday \u201cinto gear\u201d Thursday night. He said he had directed companies to launch production. But then he walked it back, saying, \u201cYou know, so far, we haven\u2019t had to\u201d because companies are volunteering.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The administration also announced a further closing of the nation\u2019s border, as the U.S. and Mexico agreed to limit crossings to all but essential travel and trade, while the U.S. moved to restrict entry to anyone without documentation.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Later Friday, the White House said a member of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s staff had tested positive for the new coronavirus. Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller said the staff member, who is not being identified, did not have \u201cclose contact\u201d either the vice president or Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Unveiled Thursday, McConnell\u2019s rescue proposal from Republicans builds on Trump\u2019s request for Congress to \u201cgo big.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The GOP plan proposes $300 billion for small businesses to keep idled workers on payroll and $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries. It also seeks to relax a just-enacted family and medical leave mandate on small to medium-sized businesses from an earlier rescue package.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It puts McConnell\u2019s imprint on the GOP approach after the Senate leader left earlier negotiations to Pelosi and Mnuchin, which angered some of his GOP senators feeling cut out of the final product. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Keeping paychecks flowing for workers not at work is a top priority for both Democrats and Republicans as <a class=\"\" href=\"/d2a5e80b7ba7d568e9e6a3966d6308d0\">jobless claims skyrocket.</a></p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But how best to send direct payments to Americans \u2014 as one-time stipends, ongoing payroll support or unemployment checks \u2014 is a crucial debate.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Under McConnell\u2019s approach, small businesses with 500 or fewer employees would be able to tap up to $10 million in forgivable loans from the federal government to continue cutting paychecks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Democrats prefer sending the money to workers via the existing unemployment insurance system. Schumer called it \u201cunemployment insurance on steroids.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Both income support approaches have benefits and drawbacks, lawmakers said. Republicans say their plan would keep workers linked to employers, for easy recall once the crisis abates. Democrats argue the unemployment system provides a ready-made distribution channel, though states could also become overwhelmed by the surge of jobless claims. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Meanwhile, industries of all kinds are lining up for help. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As the Senate chairmen hammered out the details \u2014 and House chairmen funneled their input \u2014 the total price tag is sure to grow beyond $1 trillion, lawmakers said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The House, which adjourned last weekend, is not expected to resume until the new package is ready.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Lawmakers on conference calls with leaders this week said they preferred not to board airplanes amid the virus outbreak. Despite calls to change the rules, Congress does not have a mechanism in place for remote voting. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump has already signed into law a $100 billion-plus bill to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers hit by it. Earlier, Trump signed an initial $8.3 billion package from Congress.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

{"title": "Trump keeps talking during market hours; stocks keep tanking", "articleDate": "March 21, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By AAMER MADHANI", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 When President Donald Trump speaks, financial markets gyrate and quiver in real time. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But that hasn\u2019t stopped the president from holding forth almost daily about the coronavirus pandemic and its economic implications without waiting until markets have closed for the day.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While many of his predecessors worked consciously to not affect the markets, Trump has overtly made market movements and performance a measure of his effectiveness and central to his argument for a second term.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Earlier this week, public health officials announced a surge of infections in the U.S. as leading economists predicted unemployment spiking to 10% or more. Trump, meanwhile, took the White House podium in the middle of the trading day to offer an optimistic take on his administration\u2019s response to the crisis. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cOne of the elements that is being worked on very much so on the Hill is to keep the jobs going so that when we do get rid of the virus, we\u2019re going to be able to just really...go like a rocket,\u201d said Trump on Thursday as at the market spiked more than 300 points, then dove into negative territory and then inched back into positive territory over the course of his 77-minute press conference. \u201cI think the economy is going to be fantastic.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president headed to the same place again on Friday while the markets were open for an even longer news conference, where he vacillated between expressing optimism and lashing out about \u201cnasty\u201d journalists\u2019 negativity. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Amid more difficult news\u2014the number of confirmed infections around the globe surpassed 250,000 cases\u2014the Dow Jones industrial average closed down more than 4.5 percent on Friday. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the end of the market\u2019s heaviest losses in more than 30 years, the market closed at 19,173.98, below where it stood on the day before Trump was inaugurated and erased the so-called \u201cTrump bump\u201d that he\u2019s pointed to throughout his presidency as evidence of his prowess as the economic steward.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nevertheless, in the midst of one of the most volatile moments ever for the U.S. economy, Trump has wagered that his voice is the daily balm needed to soothe investor concerns. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Over the course of the last eight days--all on which he held extended news conferences about the coronavirus response in the midst of trading -- his comments haven\u2019t stopped the bleeding. The Dow has lost more than 17% since March 13, and has plummeted more than 34% since the market hit an all-time high Feb. 19.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president\u2019s decision to offer daily affirmations to the health of the stock market, and the economy writ large, is not surprising. But no president has tied his fortunes to Wall Street more closely than Trump, who until the market crash bragged that the rising stock market was evidence of his success leading the economy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cMaybe, he should take it offline,\u201d\u2019 said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody Analytics. \u201cBut this president? He\u2019s not going to do that.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush avoided talking about the stock market with substance, let alone trying to impact the market in the midst of trading. Bill Clinton took to heart his economic adviser Robert Rubin\u2019s advice that markets go up and markets go down. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Barack Obama was ridiculed as the stock-picker-in-chief less than two months into office when he suggested in the midst of a market slide that it was a good time to buy undervalued stocks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For much of his next six years in office, the 44th president was often measured when even talking about the improved health of the economy: his first term started in throes of the Great Recession but he left office with 75 straight months of job growth. By the latter part of his presidency, Obama began claiming credit for the bull market on occasion.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe stock market is booming,\u201d Obama declared in a speech in a July 2014 speech in Kansas City.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Those close to Trump said he was fully aware that the coronavirus posed an enormous threat to the very same once-booming markets he touted as the calling card of his presidency, even as he was publicly downplaying concerns about the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the weeks that the pandemic ballooned into a public health emergency, Trump had become increasingly frustrated as he privately expressed concerns to his advisers about the effect the virus could have on the markets and ultimately his reelection effort, according to White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump throughout his presidency has viewed the market\u2019s performance as his \u201cdaily report card\u201d of his job performance, Zandi said. With the pandemic thrusting the economy toward a recession, Zandi said that Trump now appears to be turning to the market for an \u201chourly report card\u201d to gauge the effectiveness of his response.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIn the past, sometimes it worked and sometimes it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Zandi said of the president\u2019s years-long cheerleading of the market. \u201cRecently, it hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s in fact, as of late, done less to instill confidence and more to upset investors. They don\u2019t view his actions as very productive in terms of this crisis. It\u2019s worked against him.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Throughout his presidency, Trump has used off-the-cuff diatribes to try to shame major, publicly-traded companies whose business dealings are at odds with his political interests, tapped out timely, friendly tweets about China\u2019s Xi Jinping to calm market concerns about trade wars, and repeatedly berated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about the central bank\u2019s policies during market dips.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump has repeatedly made clear that the battered market is top of his mind, as trillions of dollars in wealth and nearly all the gains for the Dow Jones Industrial tallied since his inauguration have been erased. He has sought to will a comeback with his daily updates about his administration\u2019s efforts to contain the virus in the midst of trading day, Zandi said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It mostly hasn\u2019t worked.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump held a Rose Garden press conference on March 13, just before the New York Stock Exchange closed for the weekend, to declare a national emergency, to announce greater availability of virus testing kits were in the pipeline, and to declare he was ordering the purchase of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Later that weekend, he boasted during another news conference that the market responded to his performance with its biggest single-day gain ever. Left unsaid by the president was the fact that market had its single-worst day since the 1987 Black Monday the day before the record gain.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think we should do one of them every day, perhaps. How about five times a day?\u201d Trump remarked. \u201cWe\u2019ll do one five times a day. But that was something to watch and \u2014 I had no idea.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The huge Friday gains that Trump bragged came from his market-whispering were followed by a wipe-out Monday that saw a historic, nearly 3,000-point slide for the Dow. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Investors dumped stocks after the Fed\u2019s surprise move on Sunday evening to cut interest rates to near zero, a move that appeared to only exacerbate investor worries about a global recession. The Fed rate cut came the day after Trump again publicly berated Powell over lending rates.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Jason Furman, a Harvard University economist who served as Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, said Trump should provide important coronavirus updates whenever he and his team sees fit. But Furman also advised that Trump should \u201clet the stock market take care of itself.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said the \u201cgenie is out of the bottle\u201d with Trump\u2019s consistent attempts to shape the market through Twitter and the media. And with the global nature of the marketplace, when Trump makes his comments remains less important than the substance of his remarks, she said..</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis is where facts matter, information matters and very focused communication matters,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cHis experts should be all the focus. His job should be to be the steward right now. Often, the alpha dog isn\u2019t the first one in the pack.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u2014\u2014-</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed reporting to this article.</p>"]}

In those <a class=\"\" href=\"/fc56521fb4375ffa5375fd6daae3be5b\">Super Tuesday contests</a><!-- -->, the former New York City mayor won only one U.S. territory. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Bloomberg\u2019s contribution amounts to more than the national party\u2019s typical cash balance. The transfer will help the DNC make up for some of the steep fundraising disadvantage when compared with its Republican counterpart, which routinely has raised tens of millions more than the Democratic organization throughout election cycles.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\"><a class=\"\" href=\"/5d3d2d4aa08646924973388070933585\">One of the world\u2019s wealthiest men</a><!-- --> with a net worth estimated to exceed $60 billion, Bloomberg promised throughout his campaign that he would help Democrats try to defeat President Donald Trump regardless of how his own White House bid fared.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Bloomberg campaign, which hired a staff of 2,400 people across 43 states, will also transfer its offices in six pivotal states to the Democratic parties in those states, to help accelerate their hiring and organizing. Those states are Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Former Bloomberg campaign staffers in those offices will continue to be paid by his campaign through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April. After that, they could in theory offer the state parties a trained and ready pool of potential hires to build out their operations heading into the November general election.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Bloomberg had promised staffers when they were hired that they would be paid through November, but earlier this month most of his campaign team was told they had been let go and would be paid only through the end of March.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">DNC officials said Bloomberg\u2019s money and real-estate transfers would be used to expand the party\u2019s 12-state battleground program, with a focus on hiring additional staffers to work in organizing and data operations. Bloomberg\u2019s former campaign employees will not have any advantage in the hiring process, officials said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cMayor Bloomberg and his team are making good on their commitment\u201d to stay engaged through November, said DNC Chairman Tom Perez in a statement. He added that the support will \u201chelp Democrats win up and down the ballot\u201d and \u201chelp make sure Donald Trump is a one-term president.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Bloomberg dropped out of the race March 4, the day after his Super Tuesday disappointment. Since then he has given tens of millions of his own money to various Democratic groups and causes.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a memo to Perez announcing the transfer, the Bloomberg campaign said that while Trump\u2019s \u201cmismanagement\u201d of the coronavirus crisis should cost him, \u201cwe should also not assume that Trump\u2019s incompetence will be enough to make him a one-term President.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cTrump\u2019s ability to lie and propagate misinformation, particularly using digital tools and other means with swing voters in battleground states, will continue to ensure a close race in November. Every decision we make as Democrats must account for this,\u201d the campaign wrote.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Since exiting the race, Bloomberg has contributed $500,000 to Voto Latino to help register Latino voters, $2 million to the group Collective Future to help register African American voters, and $2 million to Swing Left, a group focused on electing Democrats in swing districts. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The DNC\u2019s battleground effort targets Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. It\u2019s a mix of states that have flipped back-and-forth between the two parties in recent presidential cycles and a few that have leaned Republican but are expected to be competitive in November. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Though the DNC will never match its GOP counterpart in financial muscle, Perez and party leaders have placed a premium on coordination across the Democratic spectrum this presidential cycle after watching Republican quietly upstage them on data operations and voter outreach in 2016. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Democrats are still putting together a data exchange that will link campaigns, the national party\u2019s voter file and voter information from independent groups such as the Priorities USA Super PAC, a major advertising and voter outreach player for Democratic efforts. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As part of that effort, Bloomberg and every other Democratic presidential candidate who bought the DNC\u2019s national voter file committed to update voter information. That means, for example, that likely nominee Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign will be able to use voter information that Bloomberg\u2019s massive campaign operation gleaned while it was in operation. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Bloomberg\u2019s direct aid to the national party is possible only because he was a presidential candidate. Federal campaign finance laws place caps on how much an individual can give a political party committee. But individuals can loan or contribute as much of their personal money to their campaigns as they want. In turn, presidential campaigns can transfer unlimited sums to official party committees.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, <a href=\"https://appodcasts.com/category/ground-game/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">\u201cGround Game.\u201d</a></p>"]}

Officials put the price tag at nearly $1.4 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve it could pump $2 trillion into the U.S. economy. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe are poised to deliver the significant relief that Americans need with the speed that this crisis demands,\u201d McConnell said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Talks will resume Sunday morning when the top four congressional leaders of both parties are set to confer privately at the Capitol with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in hopes of striking a final accord.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said there is \u201cnot yet an agreement.\u201d Spokesman Justin Goodman said Democrats look forward to reading the draft and further negotiations.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cEverybody\u2019s working hard and they want to get to a solution that\u2019s the right solution, I think we\u2019re very close,\u201d Trump said at Saturday\u2019s briefing, striking a confident tone about the nation\u2019s ability to defeat the pandemic soon. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Capitol Hill, the Senate convened the rare weekend session as negotiators raced to complete the package. The Senate\u2019s goal is to hold an initial vote Sunday and win Senate passage on Monday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The urgency to act is mounting, as <a class=\"\" href=\"/d2a5e80b7ba7d568e9e6a3966d6308d0\"> jobless claims skyrocket</a><!-- -->, businesses shutter and the financial markets are set to re-open Monday eager for signs that Washington can soften the blow of the healthcare crisis and what experts say is a looming recession. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump has largely stayed out of the details, but said Saturday that he would be lobbying the lead negotiators. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On one topic, Trump appears to be agreeing with Democrats as Washington tries to steer clear of the politically toxic bailouts from the last economic crises.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump expressed a clear distaste for any industry, including the airlines, that would use federal assistance to buy back its own stock in an effort to increase profits. Banning stock buy-backs is one of Democrats\u2019 top business priorities in the emerging package.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other top White House officials were on Capitol Hill for a second day of nonstop negotiations.

But mixed, vague messaging still ruled the briefing.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For example, as hospitals across the nation report a dire shortage of supplies to care for an expected surge of patients, Vice President Mike Pence said the government was completing a half-billion-dollar order for masks. But none of the government officials at the briefing could suggest when the masks would reach medical facilities, a moment of confusion that caused Trump to grow visibly frustrated. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, tried not to over-promise the effectiveness or speed of medication that could possibly be used to treat the virus. After Trump had exited the briefing room, Fauci answered a question about a Trump tweet about the drugs by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not totally sure what the president was referring to.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump also sowed confusion about his use of the Defense Production Act to force American businesses to manufacture needed medical supplies, saying that while he invoked the act this week, he has not yet needed to utilize it to compel businesses to mobilize, despite the pronounced supply shortage.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Pence announced that, out of an abundance of caution, he and his wife, Karen, would be tested for the virus after a member of the vice president\u2019s staff had tested positive. The result for both was negative, Pence press secretary Katie Miller tweeted Saturday night.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Pence had said the staffer, who did not have close contact with either the president or vice president, was doing well.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The emerging rescue plan from Congress would be a striking intervention at enormous cost being crafted with a speed unseen since the 2008-09 financial crisis and recession.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It builds on Trump\u2019s request for Congress to \u201cgo big.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A central element is now $350 billion for small businesses to keep making payroll. Companies with 500 or fewer employees could tap up to $10 million in forgivable small business loans to keep paychecks flowing.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That\u2019s on top of a proposal for one-time checks to all Americans, $1,200 per individual, $2,400 for couples, cut off at higher incomes.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Democrats are pushing for increased eligibility for unemployment insurance for those who jobs are simply disappearing.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For industry, the initial GOP plan called for $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries, which would have to be repaid. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Negotiators are still hammering out whether there will be money to the states, whose governors have requested billions, as well as how much will be going to hospitals and healthcare providers.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump acknowledged the outbreak was hurting his family\u2019s business of hotels and country clubs but said he did not know whether his business would be one of the many to seek government assistance.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

{"title": "Chaos, inconsistency mark launch of drive-thru virus testing", "articleDate": "March 22, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By MICHELLE R. SMITH", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) \u2014 Drive-thru sites have been opening around the United States to make it quicker and safer to test people for the new <a class=\"\" href=\"/VirusOutbreak\">coronavirus</a><!-- -->. But much like the rest of the U.S. response to the pandemic, the system has been marked by inconsistencies, delays, and shortages. Many people who have symptoms and a doctor\u2019s order have waited hours or days for a test.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">More than a week after President Donald Trump promised that states and retail stores such as Walmart and CVS would open drive-thru test centers, few sites are up and running, and they\u2019re not yet open to the general public. Some states are leaving it to the private sector to open test locations; others are coordinating the effort through state health departments.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Patients have complained that they had to jump through cumbersome bureaucratic hoops and wait days to get tested, then wait even longer for a result. Testing centers opened in some places only to be shut down shortly afterward because of shortages of supplies and staff. And while the drive-thru test centers that have opened are generally orderly, there have been long lines at some.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The slow ramp-up of the COVID-19 testing and the spotty nature now of the system makes it hard for public health officials to track the spread of the disease and bring it under control.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe need to be testing more broadly to fully understand the scope of the public health situation we are facing,\u201d said Joseph Wendelken, a spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Health.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dr. Brett Giroir, the federal health official tasked with overseeing testing, said at a White House briefing Saturday that so far about 195,000 people have been tested in the U.S. That figure does not include some people who have been tested in private labs. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three weeks to six weeks to recover.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Drive-thru test sites have popped up in locations in more than 30 states \u2014 in state parks and parking lots, next to medical centers and universities, at the Mississippi state fairgrounds and near where the Jacksonville Jaguars play. The governor of Maryland this past week ordered vehicle emission inspection programs across the state to stop so that the locations can be used as drive-thru centers to test for the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But as of Friday there were no open drive-thru tests available in Maryland\u2019s inspection centers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Utah health department said it isn\u2019t in charge of the sites and isn\u2019t tracking them. North Carolina\u2019s health director said the state is leaving testing to the private sector and declined to say how many sites there are. By contrast, in Rhode Island, health care organizations are running the sites in partnership with the state health department. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Houston on Thursday, cars lined up for more than a mile outside a hospital when the city\u2019s first drive-thru testing site opened. U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said they administered fewer than 200 tests in the first six hours. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Elsewhere, at several sites visited by Associated Press reporters and photographers, the scenes were well-controlled and sometimes downright quiet. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dozens of people waiting in cars at a center in Homestead, Florida, on Wednesday, waited their turn to speak with a screener wearing a gown and mask and carrying a clipboard. Some were apparently turned away. Others were waved through, had their temperatures checked and were swabbed for samples.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But supply shortages have shut down drive-thrus in several states, including Colorado, New Mexico, Virginia, Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, North Carolina, and Utah. One Las Vegas site was closed because it didn\u2019t have enough workers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">New York state opened several centers to great fanfare on Tuesday. By Friday, however, New York City\u2019s health department issued an alert saying only people who require hospitalization should be tested, due to shortages of protective equipment such as face masks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said he has begged the federal government for additional test kits and supplies, but the state received a notice Thursday that all of its requests for drive-thru testing pods and testing kits \u201care on an indefinite backlog, without any estimate of a timeline for delivery.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis is our unfortunate reality Nevada. It\u2019s up to us,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The sites themselves are dotted with tents and traffic cones. The most notable features are medical personnel wearing masks, gloves and protective smocks or other clothing. They take nose and throat swabs from people sitting in their cars or help people go inside for the test.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some states have as few as one drive-thru site. Montana\u2019s sole site is in Billings, the state\u2019s largest city. Others have a few dozen. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Security guards were reported at many sites, but a survey of states by the AP did not uncover any security problems. In Rhode Island, the National Guard have been on hand to set up the state\u2019s three drive-thru sites and even to swab patients.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The vast network of drive-thru sites at retail chains that Trump said more than a week ago was coming has so far failed to materialize. CVS has opened one site in Massachusetts, which it calls a \u201cmodel for testing.\u201d Walmart said its launching two sites and Walgreens said it\u2019s launching one, all three around Chicago. Only health care workers and first responders are allowed.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The patchwork of approaches has caused confusion for patients. Caroline Mauldin was ordered to get a test by her doctor in Charleston, South Carolina, on Tuesday, after experiencing aches and chills for several days. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">To get an appointment at a drive-thru site at a medical center, she had to fill out a lengthy online questionnaire and she spent two days calling a number that rolled to voicemail and wouldn\u2019t take messages. She resorted to tweeting at the hospital several times just to move things forward.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Finally, on Thursday, she got an appointment for Monday. And she was told the results would not come back until four to five days after that. The visit will cost her $25, she said. Complicating matters, she doesn\u2019t have a car and has to borrow one from a friend.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe have a lot of elderly, low-income people here who don\u2019t have access to the internet and who don\u2019t have access to transportation. And given that they\u2019re the highest risk population, how are we getting tests to them?\u201d she asked. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In urban area such as New York and Philadelphia, some sites are providing \u201cwalk-up\u201d appointments for people with no cars. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the Penn Medicine testing site in West Philadelphia, two security officers late Thursday stood outside to make sure people who arrived by car or foot had an appointment. For about 40 minutes that evening, the line of cars never grew to more than six or seven. But Patricia Sullivan, chief quality officer of Penn Medicine, said every morning this past week, 25 to 35 cars have been lined up and six or seven walk-up patients have stood 6 feet apart under a portico waiting to be seen.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The 20 sites in greater Philadelphia are testing about 1,000 people a day, but that hasn\u2019t cleared the pent-up demand.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Rosanne Tanner\u2019s 79-year-old mother has been sick with a fever and chest pain since returning from visiting Tanner\u2019s brother and his wife, who had recently been on a cruise ship.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Her doctor ordered a test on Tuesday, but when she tried to get an appointment at a drive-thru site at a hospital outside Philadelphia, they were told \u201cthey are overloaded, they\u2019re bogged down,\u201d Tanner said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Medical staff told her they\u2019re scheduling 15 minutes apart so there aren\u2019t bottlenecks at the test site.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Finally on Thursday her mother secured an appointment for the following Tuesday. Then, she will have to wait five more days for a result. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe lag time on these tests, it\u2019s putting people at risk,\u201d Tanner said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Rhode Island, state officials said they are testing around 100 to 200 people a day at all testing sites, including three drive-thrus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Gov. Gina Raimondo said they want to perform 500 to 600 per day, but they don\u2019t have the supplies they need.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt is our absolute top priority to get to a place where everyone who needs it can be tested and you\u2019ll get the results very quickly,\u201d Raimondo said at a news conference held via Facebook Live on Friday. \u201cThen if you\u2019re positive, we can get you quarantined.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">____</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writers Michelle L.

It will require a remarkable pivot for the president, who has relentlessly cheered the stock market\u2019s rise and the economy\u2019s strength as the central predicate for a second term. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Many economists say the expected federal stimulus will not prevent a recession. Officials put the price tag of the <a class=\"\" href=\"/9aeebd670bd0bc320ae6cebd1c17ddf3\">developing package</a><!-- --> on Capitol Hill at nearly $1.4 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve, the financial rescue could pump $2 trillion into the U.S. economy. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Stocks have already collapsed. Businesses and schools are closing to try to contain the outbreak. Requests for unemployment benefits suggest that weekly layoffs could soon eclipse the worst of the Great Recession as millions of people lose their jobs. Analysts at the bank Goldman Sachs estimate that 2.25 million Americans filed for jobless aid over the past week, a total slightly higher than the job gains for all of 2019.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cNothing can stop an economic downturn now,\u201d said Aaron Sojourner, a University of Minnesota professor and former White House economist. He said that the major questions confronting lawmakers are how the country can weather a recession, when the widespread quarantines can end and how enough jobs can be preserved to stir a recovery. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The economy and politics have collided in a such a profound way that no one knows how the election will play out in November. Trump\u2019s fate may rest on just how long the downturn lasts and whether Americans judge it to be an outside shock caused by nature or the result of government negligence or incompetence.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe situation is not good -- that is different from saying the president is responsible for it,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist. \u201cIt is much easier to explain away a deep recession as an act of God.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Yet voters might not feel all that forgiving. The administration has repeatedly played down the coronavirus\u2019 health and economic risks. Only a month ago, the top White House economist suggested at a meeting with reporters that an outbreak would do little to harm growth.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI don\u2019t think corona is as big a threat as people make it out to be,\u201d said Tomas Philipson, acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, at the time. \u201cWhat I can say is that if you look at the resilience of an economy to a public health threat, certainly we have much bigger threats than the coronavirus.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The lethality of the virus has now overridden such optimism. California and New York are among the states on near lockdown status, and many others are in essentially the same place. Trump himself has abruptly changed his tone, and top federal health officials are now trying to prepare Americans for the soaring number of cases they believe are sure to come.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump has relied on his trademark salesmanship, consistently talking about how fast the economy will spring back once the virus wanes, repeatedly speaking in superlatives from the White House briefing room about how pent up demand will generate a positive surge. His words will be measured carefully by voters in little over seven months, when the fallout from the pandemic probably will be clearer. But many economists do not believe the recovery will automatically start like the flip of a switch.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president anticipates that any downturn \u2014 which analysts say could exceed an annualized rate of 10% over the next quarter \u2014 would be followed by a snapback to growth. The result is that the line charting U.S. gross domestic product would form a \u201cv\u201d shape. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI believe in the V-curve,\u201d the president said Thursday. \u201cWhen this is defeated, this hidden scourge is defeated, I think we\u2019re going to go up very rapidly, our economy, and get back to where it was and beyond.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That same optimism about a fast recovery followed the housing bust more than a decade ago. Instead, there was a gradual expansion that disappointed many voters and helped usher Trump into the presidency in 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There is a risk this time that the United States could be trapped in a \u201crecession doom loop,\u201d said Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University professor and the top economist in George W. Bush\u2019s White House when the 9/11 terrorist attacks provoked similar concerns about a slowdown.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hubbard said many of the proposed stimulus ideas would not help restore growth once the virus subsides. Consumers would benefit from checks that could come to $1,200 per individual. But loans and tax breaks would not replace the lost revenues of many small businesses and manufacturers. This means those companies might stay permanently closed and the recovery would be sabotaged. Half of small businesses surveyed this past week by Goldman Sachs said they can only afford to operate for three months or less. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThat\u2019s the doom loop that I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fixable, but it requires more attention than what we\u2019re getting in Washington. This is about making sure the economy can restart.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump\u2019s political survival may well depend on whether that happens.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Yale University economist Ray Fair has developed a model for how the economy impacts elections. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Depending on inflation, Fair\u2019s model shows the majority of votes would go to the Democratic nominee, likely former Vice President Joe Biden, if the economy shrinks over three quarters at an annual rate of roughly 4.4% per person. A decline that steep has occurred seven times since 1952, but never during a presidential election year.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Robert Stein, an economist at First Trust Advisors and a former Treasury Department official, said an election in such a turbulent economy is uncharted territory.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He expects the economy to shrink at an annualized rate of 15% in March and April, hold steady in May and begin to recover in June.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf you look at traditional models relating economic growth and election results, what\u2019s happening now is not good for President Trump,\u201d Stein said. \u201cBut if the downturn is disease or illness-related, my gut \u2014 and I\u2019m not saying this as an economist \u2014 is the electorate will give you a little more of a pass. But I don\u2019t know. The sample size is zero.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three weeks to six weeks to recover</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

She said her brother expressed his gratitude for Trump\u2019s letter.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">North Korea has repeatedly said there hasn\u2019t been a single case of the coronavirus on its soil. Some foreign experts question that claim and say an outbreak in the North could cause a humanitarian disaster because of its poor medical infrastructure. Last month, the State Department expressed concerns about North Korea\u2019s vulnerability to a potential coronavirus outbreak and said it was ready to support efforts by aid organizations to contain the spread of the illness in the North.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There was no immediate comment from the White House.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kim Yo Jong said Trump\u2019s letter is \u201ca good example showing the special and firm personal relations\u201d between the North Korean and U.S. leaders. But she said it\u2019s not a good idea to \u201cmake hasty conclusion or be optimistic about\u201d the prospect for bilateral relations. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIn my personal opinion, I think that the bilateral relations and dialogue for them would be thinkable only when the equilibrium is kept dynamically and morally and justice ensured between the two countries,\u201d she said. \u201cEven at this moment we are working hard to develop and defend ourselves on our own under the cruel environment which the U.S. is keen to \u2018provide.\u2019\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Earlier, Trump sent birthday greetings to Kim Jong Un, who was believed to have turned 36 on Jan. 8. Senior North Korean official Kim Kye Gwan said at the time that the birthday messages won\u2019t lead his country to return to talks unless the U.S. accepts its demands.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kim and Trump have met three times and exchanged letters and envoys on many occasions since 2018, when they launched talks on the fate of Kim\u2019s advancing nuclear arsenal. The two leaders have avoided harsh language against each other and Trump once said he and Kim \u201cfell in love.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But their diplomacy has largely come to a standstill since the breakdown of their second summit in Vietnam in February 2019, when Trump rejected Kim\u2019s demands for broad sanctions relief in return for a partial disarmament step.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kim pressed Trump to come up with new proposals to salvage the negotiations by the end of last year. Kim later vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent, unveil \u201ca new strategic weapon\u201d and warned he would no longer be bound by a major weapons test moratorium.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In recent weeks, North Korea has fired a slew of artillery and other rockets into the sea in what experts say is an attempt to improve its military capabilities. The weapons were all short range and did not pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland. A resumption of long-range missile or nuclear weapons tests by Kim would likely completely scuttle diplomacy with Trump, experts say.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">KCNA said Kim watched the test firing of tactical guided weapons on Saturday with Kim Yo Jong and other top officials. South Korea\u2019s military called the demonstration \u201cvery inappropriate\u201d at a time when the world is struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">South Korea\u2019s military said Saturday it detected two presumed short-range ballistic missiles that flew from a site in western North Korea across the country and landed in the waters off the east coast.

Outside its walls, state officials put in place an unprecedented shutdown of public life and Trump scrambled to fight a virus that he had accused political opponents and the media of pushing as a \u201cnew hoax.\u201d Criticism of the president\u2019s preparedness was rampant. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Inside, customers gave Trump an A-plus on his response to the spreading pandemic. \u201cHe\u2019s doing great things,\u201d the owner said Wednesday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">America has a history of unifying in trying times and rallying around the president. But after years of deep division, in the earliest, head-spinning days of the pandemic, a fractured electorate largely viewed Trump\u2019s performance through the lens they chose long ago. But the stakes are higher than they\u2019ve ever been. The body count will rise; the economy will almost certainly crater. Trump\u2019s political fate may be left up to the sliver of moderates in the middle, who will choose whether to blame him for the crisis spiraling on his watch. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis could be the coup de grace of his presidency. The way he handles this, history will judge, as well as the American people,\u201d said Brandon Brice, host of a radio show called \u201cStraight Talk\u201d in Detroit, who supported Trump in 2016 and is looking to how he handles this crisis before deciding if he will again. \u201cThis is the president\u2019s moment, right now.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump for weeks denied the seriousness of the outbreak when it first emerged in China. In January, he assured the nation that \u201cwe have it very well under control\u201d and he compared the virus to the seasonal flu. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">His supporters followed his lead: Surveys from early and mid-March found distinct differences in how Democrats and Republicans reacted. A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 36% of Democrats said they were very worried that they or family members would contract the virus, compared with 21% of Republicans.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Views on Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis are also shaded heavily by partisanship. A Gallup poll found 82% of Republicans expressed some confidence in Trump. Among Democrats, that number was just 12%. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, noted throughout Trump\u2019s presidency, his approval rating has hovered between 42% and 46%, with little change despite the endless cycle of controversy and chaos. Recent polling shows that has remained steady. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAttitudes about the president, both pro and con, are deeply ingrained and almost impervious to the effect of news,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve never had an event quite like this one.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the new virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority recover. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Globally, there have been more than 11,000 deaths from over 275,000 confirmed cases, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University. More than 200 deaths have been recorded in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At another time, a president might have expected to see his popularity rise. Past presidents have seen their approval ratings jump in times of crisis, disaster or war. President Jimmy Carter\u2019s approval rating skyrocketed in the weeks after Americans were taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Iran. President George W. Bush was hailed for his unifying voice after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump this week abruptly turned to talking about the virus as a significant threat, and himself as a steady \u201cwartime\u201d leader. He shifted the blame to China and tried to rebrand Covid-19 as the \u201cChina virus.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said the shift from skeptic to wartime president may be difficult for Trump. He compared the president\u2019s response with that of Republican President Herbert Hoover, who oversaw the Great Depression and dismissed the collapse of the stock market as exaggerated. When it proved disastrous, shantytowns came to be known as Hoovervilles. He was trounced in the next election by the Democratic governor of New York, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who then steered the nation through the depression and World War II. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cHe started off a Herbert Hoover and he done a 180 trying to be FDR,\u201d Brinkley said. Voters in November will judge which one he is closer to being, he said, and some of that will be based on things now largely out of his control: how many die, how painful the economic fallout proves to be.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">If the virus lingers through the summer, \u201che\u2019s going to be left holding the bad soundbites and being seen as the leader who failed us when the bell rang \u2014 he was missing in round one for a 10-round fight,\u201d Brinkley said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf it\u2019s contained, people will say he was slow out of the gate, but once he got on the job, he understood the magnitude of what was happening and did the right things, and he might skate by on a better-late-than-never approach.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">David Ropeik, a retired Harvard instructor on risk communication, is even more skeptical of Trump\u2019s ability to reshape himself as a leader able to unify a profoundly polarized nation.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThere are just a whole bunch of people who aren\u2019t going to buy that,\u201d Ropeik said. \u201cHe can\u2019t change out of a MAGA hat into a general\u2019s helmet.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Ropeik said the most important thing for a leader in crisis is to be viewed as trustworthy \u2014 and the trust gap may be a crucial divide come November.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis race is going to be determined by a bunch of swing voters in a handful of states. Those who are not the most devoted fans, who have any kind of slight ambivalence, this could well add to their mistrust,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Donald Scoggins, a retired real estate broker in Virginia who describes himself as a moderate Republican, was leaning against voting for Trump before the virus hit. He said he\u2019s seen nothing so far to change his mind. Trump was too slow to react, Scoggins said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cHe\u2019s just too divisive. We need a person at the helm that people can rally around, we need a sort of cheerleader who makes people feel confident, that can bring people together,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Brian Johnson, a Democrat and semi-retired corporate executive in Boulder, Colorado, is much hotter. He\u2019s watched Trump\u2019s reaction since January, worrying about his dismissal of the disease. Now he\u2019s infuriated with the president. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cTrump\u2019s never been double-digit approval rating for me, and now it\u2019s like, can you go lower than zero?\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But across the country, in states critical to the outcome of the election, Trump\u2019s ardent supporters defended his actions and followed his lead to blame China. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Luzerne County, a historically Democratic area in eastern Pennsylvania that flipped in 2016 to vote for Trump, Lynette Villano said she thinks the economy is resilient. It started from an extraordinarily high point, she said, and Trump deserves credit for giving the country the economic strength to be able to take the punch. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Villano, a billing clerk who wears a rhinestone Trump pin, has chronic lung disease and survived cancer twice. She recognizes she\u2019s among those at highest risk. She says she\u2019s not worried, she deeply trusts the president to look out for her, and she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s time for political posturing and finger-pointing. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf anything, this is going to show him as a strong leader who stepped forward and took every action possible to make things better,\u201d she said from her home, where she\u2019s waiting out the pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Florida, the owner of the Trump-themed cafe posted a message on its Facebook page: \u201cThose on the LEFT have fought for our downfall since day 1 and now the Corona \u2018CHINESE\u2019 VIRUS is impacting our business.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Owner Cliff Gephart said he fully supports Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis and trusts him to steer the country to calmer waters.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cEvery decision the president makes, whether it\u2019s about coronavirus or about the economy or taxation. It seems like coronavirus is just another partisan, down party lines,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">One of his customers, 80-year-old George Latzo, said he wasn\u2019t concerned enough about the virus to abide the public warnings to avoid gatherings.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI\u2019ve lived a long healthy life and I don\u2019t know if this is going to be worse than the flu,\u201d said Latzo, who wore a Trump 2020 hat and a black t-shirt that said, \u201cDonald Pump,\u201d depicting a muscular President Trump doing a bicep curl. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___ </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writer Nicholas Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Instead, the Vermont senator and democratic socialist is back in a familiar place: on the outside looking in.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">After being routed in Democratic primary contests for the third consecutive week by former Vice President Joe Biden, Sanders faced the grim calculation on Wednesday that he has virtually no chance of clinching the Democratic nomination. He would need to win a whopping 63% of the remaining delegates to do so.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That left him with a series of wrenching decisions. Sanders could stay in the race and use its national platform to keep pressing for the issues he\u2019s most passionate about, such as a single-payer health care system. He could yield to growing pressure to step aside and let the party coalesce around Biden and focus on defeating President Donald Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Or he could simply stall for more time as the campaign takes an awkward pause with much of the nation\u2019s attention on combating the coronavirus, which has caused states to push back their upcoming primaries and left the next major contests weeks away. That would also allow Sanders to try to exact additional policy concessions from Biden, who has already adopted his rival\u2019s free-college tuition plan. He could also shape the Democratic Party platform during the upcoming convention.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For a campaign that has inspired millions to activism, the choice of what\u2019s next ultimately falls on a small group: Sanders and his wife, Jane. And he made clear Wednesday he wouldn\u2019t be rushed. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cStop with this,\u201d Sanders told reporters outside the Senate chamber when pressed on when he might suspend his campaign. \u201cRight now I\u2019m trying to do my best to make sure that we don\u2019t have an economic meltdown and people don\u2019t die.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He said the country is \u201cin the midst, literally -- I\u2019m not using that word easily -- of an unprecedented crisis in our lifetime, and that\u2019s what we have to focus on right now.\u201d But Sanders also implied that the global pandemic might have unfairly skewed Tuesday\u2019s results, in which he was roundly defeated in Florida, Illinois and Arizona.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cYou tell me what happened yesterday. Do you think those were orderly elections?\u201d he said. \u201cGod willing, please, November, we\u2019re not where we are right now.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Ohio\u2019s governor ordered polls closed mere hours before voting was supposed to begin Tuesday, and some voters and election officials reported problems in the states that proceeded with casting ballots.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Asked if the numbers would have been different under more normal circumstances, Sanders said: \u201cWho knows? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Despite the disappointing results in recent contests, Sanders still attracts a loyal following. As a movement politician, his next steps could help determine whether his backers accept defeat or spend the coming months criticizing Biden \u2014 potentially leaving him weakened going into the general election.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, has continually blamed bad feelings from her primary fight against Sanders as a factor in her defeat to Trump in the fall.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Speculation about Sanders\u2019 candidacy intensified Wednesday morning when his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said the senator was \u201chaving conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Many Sanders supporters say they were unbowed.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cOur hope is he stays in the race and continues through the convention,\u201d said Derrick Crowe of People\u2019s Action, an activist organization that has endorsed Sanders.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the progressive group Democracy for America, said Sanders can play a potentially \u201ccritical\u201d role in unifying the party by continuing his campaign.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cBernie has already made it clear that he will 100% support the Democratic nominee and that he\u2019s going to campaign for Joe Biden if that\u2019s who it is,\u201d Chamberlain said. \u201cThe reality is, that\u2019s not 100% true for all Bernie Sanders supporters. So there is a real value to Bernie staying in the race as long as possible to bring those people into the party deeper.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That underscores the sensitivity of how Sanders proceeds. Justin Bamberg, a South Carolina state representative and Sanders supporter, said it\u2019s wrong to assume that, if the senator quickly drops out, his backers would unite behind Biden.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake for the party, regardless of whether the nominee is Biden or Bernie, to think that beating Donald Trump in and of itself will be enough motivation for the average person living their day-to-day life to come out and be excited about voting in November,\u201d Bamberg said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Meanwhile, the Biden campaign is proceeding with caution, carefully avoiding any moves that would seem like gloating while Sanders decides his future.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Still, Biden\u2019s new campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, is focusing on general election strategy. And Biden campaign co-chairman, Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, has said the former vice president has already begun considering possibilities for his vice presidential pick \u2014 even though no formal vetting process has yet been launched.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Biden\u2019s senior adviser Anita Dunn said the campaign is moving ahead as if the former vice president will clinch the nomination.

But, amid the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic, put the emphasis on waiting.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Biden holds an essentially insurmountable delegate lead over his last remaining rival, Bernie Sanders, yet the Vermont senator remains in the race. And with several states delaying their primaries to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, Biden can\u2019t reach the required majority of pledged convention delegates until May or June. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The former vice president, who proudly calls himself a \u201ctactile politician,\u201d can\u2019t chase those votes in public because he\u2019s essentially confined to his Delaware home like any other American in a quasi-national quarantine. His new campaign manager and her staff are working from home, too.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For now, Biden\u2019s campaign has little choice but to embrace an unprecedented political purgatory.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThree weeks ago, we were on the verge of collapse as a campaign, so this is a very recent phenomenon,\u201d said Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn, insisting that the 77-year-old candidate remains focused on playing a productive role in the coronavirus response and sewing up a nominating fight that he doesn\u2019t see as finished.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe will figure out how to put together a general election campaign for this difficult time,\u201d Dunn said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Biden is confident enough in his position, campaign co-chairman Cedric Richmond said, that he\u2019s started to consider possibilities for a running mate. But Richmond said no vetting process has begun in earnest.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">His former Democratic presidential rivals have coalesced around him, too. On Wednesday alone, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard <a class=\"\" href=\"/7459966c64f579029df988ad8d599f50\">dropped out of the race</a><!-- --> and threw her full support behind Biden, and New York Sen.

But in the same gathering where O\u2019Malley Dillon was introduced, she and Dunn told the staff they were shuttering the Philadelphia headquarters and all other Biden offices. With social distancing already taking hold nationally, Biden and his wife, Jill, addressed the group by telephone from their Wilmington home.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The campaign has promised the expected build-out from a relative shoestring staff \u2013 growth having been hampered by Biden\u2019s inconsistent fundraising until his recent primary victories \u2013 into a national footprint befitting a nominee. But as O\u2019Malley Dillon plots general election strategy, there\u2019s little evidence that mass hiring is imminent.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Andrew Bates, who runs Biden\u2019s \u201crapid response\u201d communications unit, said the campaign is recruiting \u201ctalented people from other presidential campaigns and from elsewhere.\u201d Yet some staffers from defunct campaigns told The Associated Press they\u2019ve had only initial conversations, with no follow-up, and others said they were told the campaign isn\u2019t hiring for their roles in the immediate future.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their job prospects.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Digital fundraising efforts continue, with the campaign pushing the usual texts and emails asking for small-dollar contributions.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But high-dollar fundraising events are on hold, including any possibility of a joint fundraising agreement with the Democratic National Committee. That deal, typically forged between nominees and the party, would allow individual megadonors to contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars each to the party and certain Biden operations, exponentially multiplying the usual $2,800 limits on individual contributions to the Biden campaign. But the hooks of that fundraising approach are swanky in-person events that allow donors close contact with a would-be president. No one knows when those can happen again.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Meanwhile, Biden and his aides must also react to President Donald Trump and developments in the coronavirus outbreak and response. While challengers to incumbent presidents always play a reactionary role, that\u2019s especially true for Biden, who has built his entire campaign as a juxtaposition with Trump. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But now Trump and his team have an even more dominant media megaphone with an endless loop of White House briefings and congressional machinations in response to the crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As an example, Biden has used two formal addresses to pan Trump\u2019s response as slow and inadequate. Yet since then, the president has signed an initial aid package and endorsed a massive program for direct aid to every adult American \u2014 a turn that underscores the difficulty Biden may face countering Trump with a \u201cfront-porch campaign\u201d from Delaware. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think you\u2019ve seen in the last week, certainly, that the vice president is going to put policy considerations ahead of political considerations,\u201d Dunn said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The immediate wild cards for Biden, though, are Sanders and the shifting primary calendar. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Though a lengthy primary could afford Biden media spotlights and fundraising hooks he might not otherwise get, Sanders\u2019 lingering presence also delays any effort to unify a party that was damaged in 2016 by a long primary fight between Sanders and Hillary Clinton. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Mathematically, there aren\u2019t enough delegates up in April for Biden to claim the nomination. But more likely, he\u2019d need to win 75% of the delegates from scheduled contests to win the nomination outright on May 19 with Sanders still in the race. If he doesn\u2019t, June 2 would become his more likely clinching date. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the least, Biden and Sanders have indicated they won\u2019t descend into a bitter fight. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Sanders was at home in Vermont on Thursday, beginning to speak to top supporters about his campaign going forward. His team understands he has virtually no chance at the nomination, but they also said Sanders wants to leave on his own terms. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Aides who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign\u2019s thinking said Sanders has given them no indication of his timeline.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a Thursday email to supporters, Sanders didn\u2019t ask for campaign contributions for the second straight day \u2014 an indication he won\u2019t be in the race much longer \u2014 but instead sought input on how best to combat the public health and economic effects of the coronavirus. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Barrow reported from Atlanta.

(AP) \u2014 Hawaii Rep.

Some past supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the state warmed to her campaign over time, and she espoused a similar outsider approach to Sanders\u2019 2016 run, which she supported.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">She was also part of what once was <a href=\"https://interactives.ap.org/2020-candidates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">a historically diverse Democratic field</a><!-- --> and the last of a half-dozen female candidates to depart the race. The 38-year-old American Samoan\u2019s campaign website described her as \u201cthe first Hindu to run for president and first practicing Hindu in Congress.\u201d And as one of the youngest candidates in the field, Gabbard outlasted senators and governors who came into the large Democratic primary race with higher profiles.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Although she failed to qualify for any stage past the fifth debate, in November, Gabbard was <a href=\"https://interactives.ap.org/delegate-tracker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">awarded two delegates</a><!-- --> once voting began, according to The Associated Press\u2019 count, both in the March 2 contest in her native American Samoa.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Yet <a class=\"\" href=\"/bb0f84b2fab44a308ee3b380bdf7d57c\">Gabbard\u2019s 2020 campaign</a><!-- --> was also quick to attract questions from voters.

Gabbard\u2019s decision became public shortly after a public feud with Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. In a podcast interview, Clinton appeared to call her \u201cthe favorite of the Russians\u201d and said she believed Republicans have \u201cgot their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Gabbard responded by calling Clinton the \u201cpersonification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d In January, she filed <a class=\"\" href=\"/8d280809da555e4e6299b92e12a8643c\">a defamation lawsuit against Clinton</a><!-- -->, saying Clinton\u2019s comments were based on either her own imagination or \u201cextremely dubious conspiracy theories\u201d that any reasonable person would know to be \u201cinherently and objectively unreliable.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Asked to comment on the lawsuit, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As most of her Democratic House colleagues <a class=\"\" href=\"/0756fda2b5143891c5da1c6897001cee\">voted to impeach Trump</a><!-- --> in December, Gabbard chose to vote present on the two articles of impeachment. Former Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie called for Gabbard to resign over the vote and said she wasn\u2019t doing her job representing Hawaii. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cLook, I did not take the easy vote,\u201d Gabbard said after returning to the campaign trail. \u201cI took the vote that I felt was in the best interest of our country and standing in the center to be able to bring the country together, to be able to begin this reconciliation that I think is so necessary in this terribly divided moment in our country.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Questions over whether Gabbard would mount a third-party run in November\u2019s general election continued following her feud with Clinton. Even as she was questioned for her present vote on the impeachment articles, Gabbard maintained that a third-party campaign was not something she was considering.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Gabbard said in December 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change.

The reserves are stashed underground in Texas and Louisiana.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s a common-sense move. Everyone who\u2019s done any personal investment knows you do your best to buy low and sell high,\u201d Brouillette said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Brouillette also denied the United States was intervening against market forces to boost U.S. oil prices.

He also asked for an embargo, hoping that would halt some of the flow of cheap oil onto the market, at least in the U.S., saying the two countries are trying to put America\u2019s shale oil drillers out of business. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that both of these countries chose -- and this was an action they thought about -- this particular time, while we have this global pandemic, to do something like this,\u201d Hamm said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hamm has close ties to President Donald Trump, having donated to Trump\u2019s campaign and served on a team of economic advisers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Congress has to approve the money for the administration\u2019s petroleum buy.

The State Department issued a new alert urging Americans not to travel abroad under any circumstances. And Trump said the government should take partial ownership of companies bailed out during the pandemic, a step that would mark an extraordinary federal reach into the private sector.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hoping to inject some good news into the dreary outlook, Trump held a White House briefing trying to highlight new efforts underway to find treatments for COVID-19 as infections in the country climbed past 11,000, with at least 168 deaths. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He offered an upbeat promotion of therapeutic drugs in early testing that he said could be \u201ca game-changer\u201d in treating those suffering.

John Bel Edwards, who told Trump he feared the state would begin to exceed its capacity to deliver health care in as soon as a week.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI\u2019m asking for help in terms of surging our medical capacity here in Louisiana,\u201d he told the president. He said the state was \u201cgoing to do everything we can to mitigate and slow the spread, but in the time that we have, we\u2019ve got to increase our surge capacity. That is my biggest concern.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As the virus threat has become more acute, Trump has begun to describe himself as a \u201cwartime president.\u201d As he and members of Congress craft bailout packages, Trump said he believed the government should take partial ownership of some companies hard hit by the pandemic and aided by taxpayers. Some Republicans in Congress have pushed back on the idea, saying it amounts to the government picking winners and losers, as they criticized President Barack Obama of doing after the 2008 financial crisis. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On the medical front, Trump and Dr. Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, described several existing drugs and treatments currently under testing to see if they can help those with COVID-19. Among them: chloroquine, a drug long used to treat malaria; remdesivir, an experimental antiviral that\u2019s being tried in at least five separate studies; and antibodies culled from the blood of COVID-19 patients when they recover.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Chloroquine is widely available already and could be used off-label, but Hahn said officials want a formal study to get good information on whether it helps people with COVID-19 and is safe. No new and imminent treatments were announced at the briefing.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe\u2019re looking at drugs that are already approved for other indications\u201d as a potential bridge or stopgap until studies are completed on drugs under investigation, Hahn said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Social distancing has proved to be a challenge in the tight quarters of the White House briefing room. When task force members walked out for the briefing, they spread out widely. \u201cWe practice what we preach,\u201d Surgeon General Jerome Adams said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But moments later, the vice president\u2019s press secretary popped out into the briefing room and directed them to move closer together, presumably to make room for her boss. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump, who is at increased risk of serious illness because of his age, stood so close to some of the officials answering questions at the podium that they could not stand fully in front of it.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump took note of the cramped quarters, too, and claimed that social distancing was making the media \u201cnicer.\u201d Yet he later laced into reporters, suggesting he would like to limit briefings to two or three of his favorite supporters. And he assailed some of his coverage, slamming as \u201cfake news\u201d outlets whose reporters have worked to hold his administration accountable for its delayed response. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writer Matthew Perrone contributed to this report.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

About $170.74 would be allocated per VA employee in certain divisions for hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes and antiviral face tissue for the rest of the budget year that ends Sept. 30.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAll that gives is an added safety boost,\u201d Dr. Richard Stone, the agency\u2019s top health official, said in an AP interview.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">During national emergencies such as the one declared by President Donald Trump last week, the VA not only serves 9 million veterans but also acts as a backup health care system to the broader public.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">If called upon by states and the Health and Human Services Department, the <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/health/aboutvha.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">VA network</a><!-- --> of 170 hospitals, 1,074 outpatient sites and more than 350,000 employees could provide care to first responders and civilians in hard-hit communities.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It could be an unprecedented task for the VA, which has faced past criticism for staff shortages, management disarray and long patient wait times.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Since January, the department has run drills and checked stockpiles of medical equipment. As coronavirus spread in the U.S., the VA locked down visitation at its 134 nursing homes and 24 spinal cord injury centers to protect elderly and vulnerable patients and screened patients for symptoms of the virus before they entered facilities. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">To increase capacity, the VA has cut back on routine appointments, limiting dental work and canceling elective surgeries, according to Secretary Robert Wilkie, who was belatedly added to the White House coronavirus task force this month.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the U.S., there are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the VA, officials said they were tracking at least 83 cases of veterans who showed signs of the virus. One patient in their 70s died late last week at a VA facility in Portland, Oregon, of complications from COVID-19. The department currently has 1,200 coronavirus test kits from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 2,000 VA-developed tests. More than 800 veterans have been tested so far.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A group of Democratic senators and the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee have pressed the VA to provide regular updates on its preparedness and available resources to address the pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cVA must be properly prepared to respond to the unique needs of our nation\u2019s veterans, and ready to activate its critical Fourth Mission to support all Americans if it becomes necessary,\u201d said Montana Sen. Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He urged the agency, which currently has more than 44,000 vacancies, to work aggressively \u201cto determine both immediate and projected needs for health care workers and first responders on the frontlines \u2014 including beds and personal protective equipment.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Joe Chenelly, executive director of American Veterans, or AMVETS, said veterans were anxious and uncertain about their health care amid the outbreak, with information from the VA often slow in coming.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe understand that the VA has a crucial role in a public health crisis, and we\u2019re ready for whatever that means,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the same time, Chenelly said, more than half of veterans are older and face a higher risk from the virus and younger veterans have chronic health conditions related to their military work. \u201cThere is perhaps no segment of the American population more at risk of being decimated,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Asked this week at what point VA hospitals or Defense Department medical facilities might be tapped by federal health officials to help relieve an overburdened private health care system, Trump pointed to pockets of the U.S. where medical personnel are showing strain.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cSome areas \u2014 like New York, California, State of Washington \u2014 they\u2019re going to have some difficulty.

He was ordered released by a judge because more than 10 years had passed since the crimes he was accused of committing.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Trump administration trumpeted the twin releases, though done in different countries and for different reasons, as part of its efforts to secure the release of Americans held hostage or imprisoned abroad.

He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for insulting Iran\u2019s supreme leader and posting private information; the State Department said he was serving a 13-year sentence. His mother had called for White\u2019s immediate release in an interview with The Associated Press this month, saying she was concerned about the well-being of her son and that he had been battling cancer.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cHe is in very good spirits, but has some pretty sustained health conditions that are going to require some attention,\u201d Brian Hook, the U.S. special envoy for Iran, said on a conference call. Hook said White would be evaluated by doctors.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fakhoury was on his way back to the U.S. after a judge in Lebanon ordered him released. Fakhoury had been accused of torturing prisoners at a jail run by an Israeli-backed militia two-decades ago. He had been imprisoned since September after returning to Lebanon to visit family. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">His case had put a significant strain on already troubled ties between the U.S. and Lebanon. Lawmakers in Washington had threatened to withhold critical aid to the country and impose sanctions on the Lebanese military, which is seen by the Trump administration as a bulwark against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAnytime a U.S citizen is wrongfully detained by a foreign government, we must use every tool at our disposal to free them,\u201d said Sen.

No family should have to go through what the Fakhoury family has gone through.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">His oldest daughter, Guila Fakhoury, told the AP by phone, \u201cWe are so happy. It\u2019s a dream.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fakhoury was diagnosed with Stage 4 lymphoma and had been hospitalized in Lebanon.

But he was not immediately allowed to leave the country after a Lebanese military judge on Tuesday appealed the decision, asking a military tribunal to strike down the decision to free Fakhoury.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The parliamentary bloc of Hezbollah criticized the military tribunal for what it called \u201csuccumbing\u201d to U.S. demands to release Fakhoury, describing him as \u201can agent who betrayed his country.\u201d Hezbollah lawmakers called on concerned authorities to hold the tribunal accountable.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hours before Shaheen announced Fakhoury\u2019s release, a U.S. Marine Osprey was seen taking off from the U.S. Embassy compound northeast of Beirut. He was being returned to the U.S. in a State Department medical plane, said Assistant Secretary of State David Schenker.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Separately, hours after the release, the U.S. embassy announced that all of its non-essential personnel had been ordered to leave Lebanon. An official in Washington said the decision to move to ordered departure was not connected to the release and was instead made due to the spread of the coronavirus and the uncertainty of transportation. The embassy will be operating with only emergency consular services available for American citizens for the foreseeable future.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fakhoury is a former SLA member who became a U.S. citizen last year. His case has been closely followed in New Hampshire, where Shaheen and other officials have called for imposing sanctions on Lebanon to pressure Beirut to release him.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fakhoury was jailed last year after returning to Lebanon on vacation to visit family. Lebanon\u2019s intelligence service said he confessed during questioning to being a warden at Khiam Prison, which was run by the SLA during Israel\u2019s 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Human rights groups have described the prison as a center for torture.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fakhoury\u2019s family and lawyer, however, said he had no direct contact with inmates and was never involved in any interrogation or torture.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fakhoury\u2019s family said in a statement said they have been through a nightmare \u201cthat we would never wish on anyone.\u201d They thanked Trump and members of his administration and said Fakhoury \u201cconsiders Shaheen his hero.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Lebanon and Israel have been officially at war since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948.

They\u2019re being replaced \u2014 for now \u2014 with tools of the digital world: tele-town halls, virtual fundraisers and livestreamed speeches from candidates\u2019 homes, sometimes with awkward results. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The abrupt shift has infused the contest with an added degree of uncertainty. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">With control of the White House at stake, candidates have been forced to ditch well-honed strategies in favor of untested tactics. There are doubts about whether they will be able to continue raising crucial cash as unemployment soars and the economy sputters. There are also concerns that a virtual campaign could foster the spread of misinformation and maybe even force the cancellation of the major party conventions this summer. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cNobody\u2019s had to put together a general election strategy in the circumstances we face today,\u201d Anita Dunn, Biden\u2019s senior adviser, told The Associated Press. \u201cI like to say every election is different.

But he lacks the robust digital operation that Sanders and Trump have. And his early experiments in online campaigning have had mixed results. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Biden aimed to appear presidential during a livestream Tuesday night, when <a class=\"\" href=\"/87b33645ee45b69a953e5a45a95698d6\">he won primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona</a><!-- -->.

At one point, Biden wandered off-camera.

Though the Republican has the megaphone of the presidency, <a class=\"\" href=\"/b753e66828b903730b69cbcddbd1c84d\">his dismissive early response to the virus</a><!-- --> and denials that a pandemic was spreading have been largely panned. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the same time, he\u2019s being denied the ability to hold the freewheeling rallies that are a staple of his presidency and that allow him to blow off steam, attack rivals and often shift the media narrative. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As campaign offices have emptied out and workers telecommute from home, trainings for his reelection effort are now being done virtually, as are all voter contacts.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, said the campaign is \u201cbest equipped\u201d for the pivot to virtual campaigning. But no amount of technology can replicate the arena rallies that have served as mass organizing and communication events for his reelection.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Murtaugh said the campaign hopes to roll out \u201clive and interactive\u201d events with surrogates online in the coming days. Still, don\u2019t expect to see Trump participating in them. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Murtaugh said that as Trump and Vice President Mike Pence hold televised briefings daily, the campaign\u2019s role is to amplify their message.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAmericans want to see that their president and their government is on the case,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While Biden has called for the country to come together for a moment of bipartisanship to address the crisis, other Democrats are itching to use Trump\u2019s handling of it as an election-year attack. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cUsing Trump\u2019s own words and actions to remind people of his failures while he tries to rewrite history is essential,\u201d tweeted David Plouffe, Barack Obama\u2019s former campaign manager.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">So far, at least, a political committee affiliated with Trump\u2019s reelection has opted against taking the same course. America First Action, a super PAC sanctioned by Trump, has postponed plans to spend millions attacking Biden in TV ads while the crisis in ongoing. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Another area of uncertainty is whether any of the contenders will still be able to rake in gobs of money, the lifeblood of any campaign. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">With big-dollar events on hold, the candidates and the parties could struggle to bring in large checks. The financial uncertainty could also depress grassroots donations from those who give small amounts online. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe have to be thoughtful about how we ask people for money,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into a space where the economy is going to be tougher.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Not everyone is concerned, though. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAny Democratic Party official who\u2019s agonizing over what type of fundraising we do or what type of convention we\u2019re going to have should get out of group therapy, go to JoeBiden.com and make a donation,\u201d said Robert Zimmerman, a prominent New York donor and Democratic National Committee member who said he would be fine casting his ballot for Biden during a virtual convention. \u201cThe pandemic that we\u2019re facing and the threat it represents puts everything in the proper perspective.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But it\u2019s not just the presidential candidates who will have to grapple with this new reality. Down-ballot candidates could find the shift to an all-digital campaign particularly challenging because many of them are running on much thinner budgets and have less money to spend on ads and staff to make up for the loss of in-person interaction.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf you have no money, and you\u2019re dependent on meeting people out in organic environments, the challenges you now face are huge,\u201d said Kelly Dietrich, CEO of the National Democratic Training Committee, a group that trains Democrats who want to run for office or work on a campaign. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Even well-funded players in the presidential race are feeling the pinch.

But during the span of a few days, Adams had said that Trump sleeps less than he does but was in better health, echoed Trump\u2019s argument that most Americans should be more worried about the seasonal flu than the new virus and defended the Republican president\u2019s claim that Democratic lawmakers\u2019 politicization of the crisis was, in Trump\u2019s words, a \u201cnew hoax.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the same news conference where Trump praised him, Adams scolded the media for \u201cbickering\u201d and \u201cpartisanship\u201d in their coverage of the administration\u2019s missteps. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cNo more criticism or finger-pointing,\u201d Adams said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\"><a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/about/previous-surgeon-generals/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Surgeons general</a><!-- --> rarely garner much attention.

Dr. Jocelyn Elders was fired by Bill Clinton after she affirmed at an AIDS conference that it may be appropriate to promote masturbation to help dissuade young people from engaging in risky sexual activity. Dr. Richard Carmona said after he left the office that the George W.

The White House also says that Adams and other high-profile administration officials will appear in nationally broadcast public service announcements that highlight how Americans can protect themselves and those most at risk.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A spokeswoman for Adams said he was not available to comment.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It was his relationship with Pence that brought Adams to Washington. When Adams arrived on the job in 2017, he was well-regarded by public health experts and industry insiders and in his adopted state of Indiana, where he served as state health commissioner when Pence was governor.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Adams played a key role in persuading Pence to back a <a class=\"\" href=\"/c4111b8ff9105edc7b210fc2e8c25d9b\">needle exchange</a><!-- --> after an HIV outbreak in rural Indiana among intravenous drug users. After Trump appointed Pence to take over the administration\u2019s coronavirus response in late February, the vice president added Adams.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI have seen him communicate well and organize well and he brings around him a team of people that know things he doesn\u2019t know \u2014 always the sign of a good leader,\u201d said Beth Meyerson, a health policy expert at the University of Arizona who worked closely with Adams during the HIV outbreak in Indiana.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Others in the public health community say he\u2019s strayed from the traditional role of the surgeon general as \u201cthe nation\u2019s doctor\u201d and administration\u2019s chief medical adviser.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cJerome Adams came in with a great reputation,\u201d said Kavita Patel, a Johns Hopkins Medicine internist who served as a senior adviser in the Obama administration. \u201cThere was the comment he made about South Korea. At times, it feels like there is a little too much politics in how he\u2019s been speaking about the administration\u2019s coronavirus efforts. That\u2019s where, unfortunately, he loses credibility. The office should not be political.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Adams was a \u201cbright and engaging\u201d doctor while he was Indiana\u2019s state health commissioner, said Charlie Brown, who was the top Democrat on the Indiana House public health committee at the time of the 2015 HIV outbreak in southern Indiana. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">More than 180 HIV cases were tied to needle-sharing among intravenous drug users who were injecting a liquefied painkiller. Pence, citing law-and-order objections, had resisted calls to allow needle-exchange programs to stem the spread of diseases. Eventually, with the guidance of Adams, Pence came to reluctantly agree to the distribution of clean needles.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cHe was right on point with those issues that were impacting health care in Indiana when he was here,\u201d Brown added. \u201cBut now it is like a different world. It\u2019s unreal. The Jerome Adams that I knew and the one that I see step before the microphone now just does not make any sense.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Elders, the Clinton administration-era surgeon general, said she first came to know Adams during his time as Indiana\u2019s state health commissioner and was quickly impressed. She described him as the type of medical professional who can provide Trump and Pence with sound advice in shaping policy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cHis heart\u2019s in the right place, he\u2019s a good physician and good scientist,\u201d Elders said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Elders added that Adams\u2019 wading into politics undermines the credibility of the surgeon general\u2019s office.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the surgeon general\u2019s place to be scolding the media about politics,\u201d Elders said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

Andrew Cuomo\u2019s matter-of-fact and slightly scolding demeanor from an epicenter of the pandemic was a stark contrast Thursday to the often haphazard and hyperbolic messages coming from Trump. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI tell my daughters: Make decisions based on risk versus reward,\u201d the Democrat said at his Thursday briefing. \u201cFor young people to go out in crowds on spring break is so unintelligent and reckless, I can\u2019t even begin to express it. Stay home. Stop the spread. Save lives.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Through daily briefings and scores of media appearances, Cuomo has emerged as one of the key faces responding to <a class=\"\" href=\"/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">the pandemic</a><!-- -->. He is one of <a class=\"\" href=\"/44cca3e17cec4f818b8b16b7b35e9181\">several governors</a><!-- --> thrust into the spotlight as cases surge, forcing a reordering of American life without schools, sporting events or large crowds. The decisions to cancel events and help overburdened hospitals have often fallen to governors, like Ohio\u2019s Mike DeWine, a Republican, who <a class=\"\" href=\"/1cf882a5a45b584e30e0663fb7667421\">postponed the state\u2019s primary</a><!-- --> this week, and Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, who drew Trump\u2019s ire for criticizing the federal response.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But it has been Cuomo\u2019s daily briefings that have become must-see TV. Twice this week, the White House\u2019s own coronavirus briefing was delayed until Cuomo concluded his own update, providing vital information to a public largely shut in at home, televisions anxiously tuned to cable news.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">His appearances drew praise from some unlikely sources.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI continue to be impressed with the briefings given by @realDonaldTrump and his world-class experts,\u201d tweeted Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney. \u201cSimilarly, my Governor, Andrew Cuomo who is keeping us well informed.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Meanwhile, an unexpected online fan club has popped up, full of adoring Twitter posts during the governor\u2019s briefings and one Jezebel article Thursday titled \u201cHelp, I Think I\u2019m In Love With Andrew Cuomo???\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It\u2019s a remarkable show of affection for a governor who has long been more respected than loved, one who is in his third term in an overwhelmingly Democratic state yet has never been embraced by the party\u2019s liberal base, who at times have grown frustrated with his centrist approach. He has twice toyed with running for president but never launched a campaign.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Still, his very public tactics have positioned him as the Democratic counter to Trump even as the party begins to coalesce around Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. Biden, who has a nearly insurmountable delegate lead in the Democratic contest, has largely kept a low profile limited to short speeches, remarks and other events livestreamed to supporters who are being advised to stay home for the foreseeable future. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As Cuomo conducts briefings from the state capital in Albany, he has vacillated between being Trump\u2019s foil and his unlikely ally. The two Queens natives have traded barbs on Twitter while also conferring in late-night phone calls placed from the White House residence.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cJust had a very good tele-conference with Nation\u2019s Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to \u2018do more,\u2019\u2033 Trump tweeted Monday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A short time later, Cuomo responded: \u201cI have to do more? No -- YOU have to do something! You\u2019re supposed to be the President.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But the two men spoke several times the next few days and Cuomo made a point, in national television interviews, of expressing his appreciation for Trump\u2019s responsiveness even as he urged the federal government to do more.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe best news is, I think the federal government has now really gotten this and they\u2019re engaged,\u201d Cuomo said Thursday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cI said to the president, you step up, you help my state, you help my people, you help this country, and I will put my hand out in partnership 100% because politics be darned right now, right?\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president, hours later from the White House briefing room, noted the comment, saying, \u201cAndrew Cuomo is being very, very generous, saying such nice things about us.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Cuomo has steered his state through crisis before, including the devastation wrought by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. He has long been drawn to proposing sweeping government projects and taking a hands-on approach to emergency responses. He worked for his father, three-term Gov. Mario Cuomo, and oversaw the response to numerous disasters as secretary of housing and urban development for President Bill Clinton.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He long has feuded with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat who once worked for Cuomo at HUD. Ruthless when wielding political power, Cuomo has at times appeared to quash de Blasio\u2019s policy proposals out of sport, and the two men have continued their rivalry during the coronavirus crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Cuomo upstaged and undermined de Blasio by ordering the city\u2019s schools to close mere minutes before the mayor was set to make the announcement, and, this week, the governor took pains to rebut the mayor\u2019s plan for the nation\u2019s largest city to shelter in place during the worst of the outbreak.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Cuomo\u2019s performance this week, to some, echoed how another polarizing New York politician commanded the national stage when the commander-in-chief was missing in action.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Giuliani, then mayor of New York City, was the face of American grief and resolve on Sept. 11, 2001, when President George W. Bush was being scrambled to safety on Air Force One in the hours after the terror attacks. Cuomo\u2019s leadership this week has been reminiscent of Giuliani in that moment of American worry, according to George Arzt, a New York Democratic consultant who was Mayor Ed Koch\u2019s press secretary and has worked with both Cuomo and Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cPeople are yearning for leadership, and they are not getting it from the Oval Office,\u201d said Arzt. \u201cAndrew really does well in a crisis. And here he is, someone taking the lead and showing on the state level what needs to be done nationally.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire</p>"]}

The last time that happened was when the court decided Bush v. Gore late in the evening of Dec. 12, 2000, essentially settling the disputed 2000 presidential election in favor of Republican George W. Bush.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Arberg wouldn\u2019t say who showed up in person Friday to the justices\u2019 conference room, adjacent to Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 office.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Six of the nine justices are 65 and older, at higher risk of getting very sick from the illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who turned 87 on Sunday, and Stephen Breyer, 81, are the oldest members of the court.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Justice Brett Kavanaugh, 54, flew on a commercial flight last week between Washington, D.C., and Louisville, Kentucky, for a ceremony in honor of U.S. District Judge Justin Walker, a former law clerk whom President Donald Trump named to the federal bench last year.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The court had previously postponed arguments that had been scheduled for the next two weeks, including a big fight over subpoenas for Trump\u2019s financial records, and closed the Supreme Court to the public. The building remains open for official business, and the court has not announced any additional postponements.</p>"]}
{"title": "Democrats fret as virus halts in-person voter registration", "articleDate": "March 20, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By ANITA SNOW and NICHOLAS RICCARDI", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 <a class=\"\" href=\"/VirusOutbreak\">The coronavirus</a><!-- --> is idling a potentially powerful force in the Democratic Party \u2014 liberal canvassers who go door to door or cruise through public gatherings, clipboard in hand, to register new voters. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Such efforts have been all but frozen because Americans now are being asked to <a class=\"\" href=\"/b64cf00f37d8da2fad3533aa7686c53d\">stay inside and keep their distance</a><!-- --> to prevent the spread of the virus. In Arizona, Latino registrations drives have moved online. In Michigan, community organizers are trying to reach out remotely. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It\u2019s a quiet change with potentially big consequences for Democrats up and down the ballot in the November general election. The party is depending on expanding the electorate to include more Latinos, young people and other groups that lean Democratic but have high rates of unregistered voters. The process of registering those voters is a yearlong, labor intensive project. An extended hiatus is a serious setback, particularly in a presidential election expected to hinge on which party turns out its key voting blocs. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe most effective engagement is person to person, so having to cease those operations will have an effect,\u201d said Clarissa Martinez, deputy vice president for UnidosUS, the nation\u2019s largest Hispanic advocacy group and formerly the National Council of La Raza. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">UnidosUS said it has moved its voter registration campaign online after temporarily sidelining in-person canvassing aimed at signing up 145,000 Latinos, mostly in Florida, but also Arizona, California, Nevada and Texas.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cNow, we are looking at texts, calls and digital tools to get people to register,\u201d Martinez said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Smaller groups are also hobbled. One Arizona, a coalition of nonprofit groups that hoped to register 250,000 new voters this year in the state said it pulled some 200 canvassers from the streets last week as public health measures shuttered schools and businesses. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Michigan, Detroit Action, which organizes minorities in that city, is practicing social distancing like much of the country. Staffers are working from home and limiting in-person contact. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of oxymoronic for community organizing,\u201d executive director Brendan Snyder said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cOur constituency, black and brown folks, are young people, housing insecure, sometimes formerly incarcerated,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cThose are vulnerable populations that will not be able to get to the polls if this thing extends.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Though Democrats have normally been most reliant on electorate-expanding efforts, a slowdown in voter registration could affect Republicans as well. President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign has <a class=\"\" href=\"/2c9022a09add4e5fbd501040c0d09d6f\">vowed to find and register thousands of new and infrequent voters</a><!-- --> to expand its voter pool. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump has sent out canvassers to expand registration and sign up new voters at his rallies, which now are on hold, like all mass gatherings. His campaign has shifted to livestreamed events featuring prominent surrogates and will push online volunteer training and voter registration.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThanks to our fantastic data operation, our team will be increasing online voter registration efforts by identifying supporters of President Trump such as rally attendees who are not currently registered to vote and making sure they\u2019re registered come November,\u201d spokeswoman Ali Pardo said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">African Americans and Latinos both have lower turnout and registration rates than whites and make up a far greater share of the Democratic electorate when compared with the Republican electorate. That forces Democrats to rely more on registering new voters and getting those who don\u2019t normally vote to come out and vote. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s a structural necessity,\u201d said Matt Morrison, executive director of Working America, a 3-million-member labor-backed national group that tries to turn out workers who do not belong to a union. \u201cThis puts pressure on us.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Morrison\u2019s group is relying on emails and text messages to reach out, but it\u2019s easier to do face to face. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Morrison expect in-person efforts will be sidelined until July, when his group will have to move scale up fast before November. He\u2019s already adjusted his targets. His group aimed to add 500,000 votes to aid the candidates they support, largely Democrats, around the country. They have scaled back that goal to 300,000 to 400,000, and in fewer states.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cEvery progressive organization needs to be looking at their plans and how it can use these lemons to make lemonade,\u201d Morrison said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Arizona, liberal groups have worked mightily to expand the minority electorate since the GOP-controlled Legislature passed a controversial immigration law in 2010. Last year, One Arizona reported registering 190,000 people, predominantly Latino and Native American. Democrats narrowly won a few statewide races for the first time in a decade, including a U.S. Senate seat.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Earlier this month, at a majority Latino high school in Phoenix, the coalition registered hundreds of students who will turn 18 before Election Day. The school is now closed, along with all others statewide.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, <a href=\"https://appodcasts.com/category/ground-game/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">\u201cGround Game.\u201d</a></p>"]}
{"title": "As virus grips nation, advocates move to halt evictions", "articleDate": "March 20, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By AARON MORRISON and KAT STAFFORD", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 On the day after the coronavirus outbreak was declared a global pandemic, Joe Ferguson was given a batch of court-ordered evictions to carry out in his job as constable in Tucson, Arizona.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He knocked on doors in the majority Hispanic community of South Tucson, told residents to gather personal effects, clothing, medications and pets, and watched as some families became homeless.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Ferguson says he strongly opposed the evictions, with the Arizona court system requiring him to toss people out of their homes even as the nation was going into a deeper state of lockdown and panic over the coronavirus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cTo serve the best interests of the entire community, while we\u2019re all facing a public health epidemic, we should allow people to stay in their homes, so that we don\u2019t stress our shelters, our hospitals and our first responders,\u201d Ferguson said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Then on Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced a proposed $1.5 trillion package that he said includes \u201cimmediate relief to renters and homeowners\u201d by suspending evictions and foreclosures for 60 days.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But, it turns out, the vast majority of renters will not be covered by the protections.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That\u2019s because the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s plan only covers single-family homes with loans through the Federal Housing Administration \u2014 roughly 8 million homeowners, most of whom are not under foreclosure, according to HUD.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That compares to the roughly 43 million households who rented in 2019, according to the U.S. Census. Roughly half rent their home from an individual investor, while the other half rent from a business or multi-unit property owner. The ones renting from a business will not receive any protections, according to HUD\u2019s proposal.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While housing advocates praised the Trump administration package as an \u201cimportant first step,\u201d they said that by excluding renters, an often economically vulnerable population, it does not go nearly far enough.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Susanna Blankley, coordinator of the Right to Counsel NYC Coalition, said she\u2019s concerned for renters and others who won\u2019t be covered by Trump\u2019s moratorium.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt will help a lot of people but ... it\u2019s a very limited subset,\u201d Blankley said. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly enough.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe need big-scale solutions,\u201d said Andrea Shapiro with the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a New York-based advocacy organization.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Renters tend to have lower incomes than their homeowner counterparts and cannot tap into the equity in their homes for a credit line it in case of an emergency. And a disproportionate number of renters are African American, Hispanic and other minorities. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Housing advocates say the situation in the United States reveals a bigger crisis with affordable housing that goes beyond the current virus emergency. And they have grave fears about what happens next, when tenants and homeowners face back payments and are still broke from being jobless. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Officials in more than three dozen cities and states, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York state, have put in place their own policies to halt evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs out of concern that the economic fallout from massive job losses will push many people to the brink of homelessness at a time when they need to stay in their houses and apartments.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The measures vary in scope, and have included a monthslong reprieve for renters and homeowners who can show that their inability to pay is related to the coronavirus upheaval.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But the majority of states and localities have yet to step in to stop people from losing their homes. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAt this point, with so much uncertainty for so many people who have not thought of themselves at risk of homelessness, to have any type of relief is helpful,\u201d said Jeff Smythe, chief executive director of Hope Atlanta, a homelessness prevention organization in Georgia. The state had an eviction rate of 4.7% in 2016, more than double the U.S. average, according to data analysis by the Eviction Lab.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cBehind all of this is the bigger crisis,\u201d Smythe said. \u201cNot having enough affordable housing, not having livable wages and the disparities around income are still with us.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms signed an order this week meant to stop nonpayment evictions by the Atlanta metropolitan area\u2019s public housing authorities for 60 days. The moratorium is a \u201ckey component of our collective community efforts to prevent further exposure and spread of this virus,\u201d Bottoms said in a statement.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Chicago on Thursday, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart announced that he was delaying enforcement of all eviction orders until April 30. During a televised address, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot asked property owners to \u201cshow grace\u201d with tenants. \u201cNo one needs the added stress of evictions, certainly not now,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">And in Michigan on Friday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order halting eviction-related court proceedings until the state\u2019s coronavirus emergency has passed. The order, which will remain in effect through April 17, allows tenants and mobile home owners to stay put even if they aren\u2019t current on their rent.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Detroit, which has one of the nation\u2019s largest African American majorities and has been particularly hard hit by foreclosures since the 2008 height of the mortgage crisis, homeowners will need relief beyond what\u2019s being offered in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, said Nicole Small, vice chair of the city\u2019s Charter Commission. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cForeclosures are stripping away the culture and fabric of the city of Detroit,\u201d Small said. \u201cHome ownership is something that\u2019s really important, especially to the black community, and now you have a lot of people who have owned homes for decades and they\u2019re actually becoming renters because they don\u2019t have any other options.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe practices and the policies are so aggressive in order to displace people but the remedies and relief, they are so few and far between,\u201d Small said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Housing advocates also said they were concerned with how economically at-risk individuals would prove that they qualify for the relief being offered by local governments.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cFolks who are performers or play music, who pick up bar-tending shifts here and there, who do various kinds of gig work are not going to show loss of income because there isn\u2019t a steady stream to begin with,\u201d said Deepa Varma, executive director of the San Francisco Tenants Union, a housing advocacy group.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe don\u2019t see how folks are going to catch up when they\u2019re already barely making rent as it is,\u201d Varma said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There are growing calls for a national \u201crent holiday\u201d long enough to help those who have lost jobs regain or find a solid financial foundation.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t have to ask, \u2018Do I use my last few dollars to get a bag of rice and beans, or do I hold onto that money to pay my rent?\u2019\u201d said Shapiro, of the Metropolitan Council on Housing in New York. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just bail out the airlines and the banks.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That\u2019s why Black Lives Matter Houston co-founder Ashton Woods has launched a petition asking Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to suspend rent, mortgage and utility payments.

While continuing missions and training, they also have to try to prevent the spread of the highly contagious <a class=\"\" href=\"/VirusOutbreak\">coronavirus</a><!-- --> by enforcing two-week quarantines of soldiers who have spent months overseas.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In one of Bragg\u2019s remote training areas, large white tents have popped up over the past few days to house hundreds of 82nd Airborne Division troops returning to the base from Afghanistan and Middle East deployments. The tent city, being called Forward Operating Base Patriot (FOB Patriot), materialized almost overnight, after commanders realized the limits of the barracks when troops began arriving on Saturday. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said senior leaders were looking into soldiers\u2019 complaints and seeking answers from Fort Bliss.

This is something unusual for all these bases to be handling, and they are doing the best they can.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the early days of the quarantine, soldiers at Fort Bliss posted photos on social media showing foam food trays dotted with small piles of peas and rice.

The troops are also allowed to go outside more and will get more access to gym equipment.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Another soldier at Bliss, who had been deployed to Kuwait, said in a message that the food has gotten better and troops are now allowed to go outside more.

Soldiers previously living in those rooms were moved to make room.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">According to officials, soldiers are being separated into groups that returned from overseas together for the two-week quarantine. But realizing the need for more space, the 82nd Airborne decided on Saturday to build a new facility, and on Monday morning the first tent stakes were being pounded into the ground.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Because the area has been used for training in the past, workers were able to quickly bring in and hook up shower and toilet trailers and set up food tents and other facilities.

Some members of that group have also come home.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">According to Army Lt. Col. Mike Burns, a spokesman for the 82nd Airborne, FOB Patriot will be able to hold as many as 600 soldiers, but numbers have been changing as adjustments are made. He said Maj. Gen.

But Burr and all the other senators pushed back strongly against suggestions that they used sensitive government information to protect their financial well-being.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The actions by the handful of senators, whose stock transactions are documented in mandatory filings to the Senate, attracted heavy scrutiny as the coronavirus pandemic continues to disrupt everyday life, wiping out jobs and personal wealth. At a moment when political leaders are urging Americans to make shared sacrifices to stop the virus, some questioned whether lawmakers were doing the same. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt appears that in a time of crisis, these senators chose instead to serve themselves, violating the public trust and abdicating their duty,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, the director the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed a Senate ethics complaint against Burr and Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia. \u201cThey must be immediately investigated.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The mandatory disclosures senators must make do not detail specific amounts of stock sales. Instead, they give a range in dollars of the value of each transaction.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Senate records show that Burr and his wife sold between roughly $600,000 and $1.7 million in more than 30 separate transactions in late January and mid-February, just before the market began to plummet and government health officials began to sound alarms about <a class=\"\" href=\"/VirusOutbreak\">the virus</a><!-- -->. Several of the stocks were in companies that own hotels.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a statement Friday, Burr said he had asked for the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate, \u201cunderstanding the assumption many could make in hindsight.\u201d He acknowledged selling the stocks because of the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Burr said he relied \u201csolely on public news reports,\u201d specifically CNBC\u2019s daily health and science reporting out of Asia, to make the financial decisions. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There is no indication that Burr, who does not plan to run for reelection in 2022, was acting on inside information. The intelligence panel he leads did not have any briefings on the pandemic the week when most of the stocks were sold, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person declined to be identified to discuss confidential committee activity. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Senators did receive a closed-door briefing on the virus on Jan. 24, which was public knowledge. A separate briefing was held Feb. 12 by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which Burr is a member of. It\u2019s unclear if he attended either session. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The stock sales were first reported by ProPublica and The Center for Responsive Politics. Most of them came on Feb. 13, just before Burr made a speech in Washington, D.C., in which he predicted severe consequences from the virus, according to audio obtained by National Public Radio and released Thursday. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Burr told the small North Carolina State Society audience that the virus was \u201cmuch more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history\u201d and \u201cprobably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Burr\u2019s remarks were darker than what he was saying publicly, and came as President Donald Trump was still <a class=\"\" href=\"/67a9a72531ca2e332bea9225cec2fda5\">downplaying the severity of the virus</a><!-- -->.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a tweet on Thursday, Burr said that Americans were already being warned about the effects of the virus when he made the speech to the North Carolina State Society. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe message I shared with my constituents is the one public health officials urged all of us to heed as coronavirus spread increased,\u201d Burr wrote. \u201cBe prepared.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Burr\u2019s North Carolina colleague, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, tweeted that the ethics review of the stock sales was appropriate. Asked in the Capitol about Burr\u2019s sales, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not respond.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Burr was not the only lawmaker to sell off stocks before the market slide. Loeffler, a new senator <a class=\"\" href=\"/28b2e7bf84e1909502c6b4c22286b658\">up for reelection this year</a><!-- -->, sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in late January and February, as senators began to get briefings on the virus, according to records. So did fellow Georgia Sen. David Perdue, another Republican lawmaker running for reelection, and also Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Loeffler\u2019s sales were first reported by the Daily Beast. In a tweet early Friday morning, she called it a \u201cridiculous &amp; baseless attack.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cInvestment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband\u2019s knowledge or involvement,\u201d she tweeted. She said she was informed of the decisions three weeks after they were made. Loeffler is married to Jeffrey Sprecher, the chairman and CEO of financial powerhouse Intercontinental Exchange.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Loeffler and her husband offloaded anywhere between about $1.1 million and $2.8 million in stock. But they plunged between $315,000 and $650,000 into real estate investment firm Blackstone, tech company Oracle and Citrix Systems \u2014 a company that develops workplace and telecommuting software. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Perdue sold off as much as $770,000 in stock in February. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In more than 40 separate transactions, he dropped a wide array of holdings, including as much as $165,000 in stock in the Nevada-based casino company that owns Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. The industry has been battered by the virus, which has led casinos to shut down. In the days after he sold the shares, the value of Caesars Entertainment Corporation stock cratered. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He also purchased shares in Disney and Delta, two companies hard hit by the pandemic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Perdue attended a Feb. 25 Senate Armed Services committee meeting where spread of the coronavirus was discussed. In the days after, he invested as much as $260,000 in pharmaceutical company Pfizer, according to a disclosure.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Perdue spokeswoman Casey Black said the senator has an outside adviser manage his investments and \u201cgoes above and beyond to fully comply with the law.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Feinstein reported that her husband sold off between $1.5 million and $6 million worth of stock in Allogene Therapeutics more than a month ago. The San Francisco-based biotech company researches and develops cures for cancer.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Feinstein, who also sits on the intelligence panel, said in a statement that she didn\u2019t attend the Jan. 24 briefing and had no input in her husband\u2019s decisions. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis company is unrelated to any work on the coronavirus and the sale was unrelated to the situation,\u201d she said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Inhofe, meanwhile, sold anywhere between roughly $395,000 and $850,000 worth of stock he held in multiple companies in late January and early February, according to a disclosure. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Inhofe tweeted that he has no involvement in his investment decisions after asking his financial adviser to move him out of stocks and into mutual funds \u201cto avoid any appearance of controversy.\u201d He said he made that move in December 2018, shortly after becoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">President Donald Trump, who has faced persistent questions about whether his family is profiting from his office, declined to say whether the sales should be investigated.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI don\u2019t know because I\u2019d have to look at it.\u201d He said of the senators: \u201cI find them to be honorable people.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">______</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro and Padmananda Rama contributed.</p>"]}

The agency said states can begin canceling tests now if they decide it\u2019s necessary as a safety measure.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said students need to focus on staying healthy and continuing to learn during closures.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cNeither students nor teachers need to be focused on high-stakes tests during this difficult time,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cStudents are simply too unlikely to be able to perform their best in this environment.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some governors had asked DeVos to lift testing requirements as they ordered statewide school closures to curb the spread of the virus. Tests in Texas, Washington and some other states had already been canceled as many schools rush to move instruction online.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The federal government\u2019s Every Student Succeeds Act requires yearly testing to measure students\u2019 progress and to identify any learning gaps among minority students or those from low-income families. The standardized tests span the elementary level through high school and typically begin in April.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">State education leaders applauded the Trump administration\u2019s move, saying they need flexibility as they prioritize the safety of their students, teachers and families.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cState chiefs strongly believe in the importance of assessments and accountability, but now is the time to focus first on the safety and well-being of all students as educators assist them in weathering and recovering from this national emergency,\u201d said Carissa Moffat Miller, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But some education groups cautioned against any widespread testing waiver, saying states can already apply for individual exemptions under the Every Student Succeeds Act.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a joint statement, several civil rights and education advocates, including John B. King, a former education secretary under President Barack Obama, said it would be \u201cpremature to issue blanket national waivers from core components of the law.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump\u2019s decision on student loans goes further than his initial plan to waive interest, but it falls short of requests from some advocacy groups. The Public Interest Research Group said loan payments should be suspended automatically rather than by request, and the group says the suspension should be guaranteed for the length of the pandemic even if it goes beyond 60 days.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWhile we applaud the president and secretary for offering much-needed relief to Americans in this public health crisis, their proposal to freeze student loans for two months does not go far enough \u2014 and could keep already-stressed borrowers in a place of economic uncertainty,\u201d said Kaitlyn Vitez, higher education campaign director for the organization.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump\u2019s directive also requires borrowers to make payments if they want to keep making progress in federal loan forgiveness programs.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, for example, certain borrowers can have their debt forgiven after making 120 monthly loan payments. Some Democrats have said borrowers should get credit toward that goal even if payments are suspended because of the virus. But the department\u2019s guidance says suspended payments won\u2019t count toward forgiveness.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump said his administration would extend the 60-day payment suspension if required, and he said there would be further changes to help borrowers.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThat\u2019s going to make a lot of students happy,\u201d Trump said of the interest and payment suspensions. \u201cAnd we have more to come on student loans, more good news for the students. But we will do that at a different time.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Also Friday, the College Board announced that for the first time students would be able to take Advanced Placement tests online at home. The tests are designed to allow high school students to earn college credit, either allowing them to earn their degree more quickly or move ahead to advanced subjects without taking introductory courses.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Almost 1.25 million public school graduates in 2019 \u2014 nearly 40% of graduates nationwide \u2014 took at least one AP test. Many states have pushed AP participation as a way to increase high school rigor and shorten the time to college degrees.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The board said it will limit subject tests to typically the first 75% of expected material that would have been covered over the full year. Officials said colleges have still agreed to grant credit for students who score high enough. The tests will be 45 minutes, and students will be able to take them on any electronic device, even a smartphone, or take a picture of handwritten work. The board says it will use security tools to prevent cheating.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The College Board said it would announce the test dates in two weeks. Students will be able to have their prepaid exam fees refunded without penalty if they choose not to be tested.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writer Jeff Amy contributed to this report.</p>"]}

But he gave conflicting accounts as to when he officially invoked the rarely used order \u2014 and even if he had ultimately done so \u2014 and did not specify which companies he was marshaling for the effort. Trump had said earlier in the week he would tap the act as needed; he then added Friday that he has put that \u201cin gear.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president also announced an effective closure of the U.S. border with Mexico, prohibiting most travel except for trade. That brings it in line with the restriction on the Canadian border earlier this week. The U.S. is also suspending interest on student loans to help young people cope with job losses and the financial crunch.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As Congress debated a financial relief package that could reach $1 trillion, officials again urged Americans to maintain social distancing. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, applauded strict new measures put in place by the governors of California and New York to limit mobility.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Trump and Fauci broke openly during the White House briefing on the possible effectiveness of new drugs being explored to treat the virus. Trump said he believed that a combination of medications he announced Thursday would work to treat the virus. Fauci said no such declaration could be made without testing, again highlighting the sharp divide between data-driven health officials and a president who admits he follows his gut.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president spent much of the Friday briefing in a fury, sparring with reporters he deemed overly critical of the response. And he again painted an unrealistically rosy picture of the outlook, as doctors and nurses have already made desperate appeals for help even as the anticipated wave of new patients has yet to hit.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump scoffed at questions about continued testing shortfalls and deficiencies in medical supplies, suggesting that even mentioning the issues was problematic. When asked to speak directly to those marooned at home and frightened, Trump voiced objection to the question itself.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter,\u201d Trump responded.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think it\u2019s a very bad signal that you\u2019re putting out to the American people,\u201d he added. \u201cThe American people are looking for answers and they\u2019re looking for hope. And you\u2019re doing sensationalism.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Vice President Mike Pence, when asked the same question later in the briefing, responded, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Be vigilant.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">More than 200 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S., and sickness from the disease is on the rise, with hospitals at risk of being overrun. Most people who get it have only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. </p>", "<p class=\"social-caption Component-root-0-2-85 Component-caption-0-2-82\">Virus US State Table: Table tracks the number of cases, recoveries and deaths for the US including its territories.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he implored Trump during a phone call Friday morning to invoke the Korean War-era act immediately to order the manufacture of ventilators and other critically needed medical gear. The president told Schumer he would and then could be heard on the telephone yelling to someone in his office to do it now, said Schumer\u2019s spokesman, Justin Goodman.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Later at the briefing, Trump said he had actually activated the measure Thursday night. He declined to reveal any companies he had ordered to step up production, though, and then walked back his claim, saying, \u201cYou know, so far, we haven\u2019t had to\u201d because companies are volunteering.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president and the Cabinet officials who briefed reporters focused on the border as they moved to restrict the entry of people without documentation. This follows a stepped-up State Department travel advisory telling Americans they should not leave the country.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On another front, Trump said the Education Department will not enforce standardized testing requirements for students in elementary through high school for the current year. Under federal education law, states are required to administer standardized tests every school year.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAmericans from every walk of life are coming together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are winning and we are going to win this war.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The administration is trying to overcome its inability to provide the needed masks, ventilators and other supplies to hospitals on the verge of being overwhelmed by coronavirus patients. Already doctors and nurses have been making desperate public pleas. And numerous local officials, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, have warned that their medical facilities will shortly run out of vital supplies, endangering both patients and health care workers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have been working toward an aid package to prop up households and the U.S. economy that would put money directly into Americans\u2019 pockets. The president has embraced the stimulus, believing it is needed to stabilize the economy and stock markets, which have been pummeled by the crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"social-caption Component-root-0-2-85 Component-caption-0-2-82\">Virus US State Map: State by state count of confirmed cases in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Mere weeks ago, Trump expected to be campaigning for reelection on the strength of a robust economy and now the nation is staring at a recession, if not worse \u2014 a difficult hand for any incumbent to play.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writers Matthew Perrone and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

James McConville, chief of staff of the Army, told Pentagon reporters the service will move to \u201cvirtual\u201d recruiting, wooing recruits more aggressively through a variety of social media sites and other online activities. He said the shutdown is \u201chappening right now as we speak,\u201d and may continue through the weekend.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Navy and Marine Corps said that they are keeping their recruiting stations open, but the services will also follow state or local guidelines. The Air Force did not immediately answer questions about their recruiting but there have been no announcements that it is shut down.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The move comes as the Army works to recover from recruiting shortfalls and struggles in recent years, prompting leaders to develop more programs to reach young people online.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said it\u2019s not yet clear how long the shutdown will last, saying the service will take things day by day.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s all going to depend on duration\u201d of the new virus, he said, adding that the Army was having a good recruiting year so far.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Marine Corps, meanwhile, said recruiters are taking steps to protect themselves and any recruits that come in.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cMarine recruiters are taking all preventative measures to protect themselves as they interact with the public, and are currently screening applicants scheduled to ship to recruit training to identify individuals who may have heightened risk factors for exposure to the novel coronavirus,\u201d said GySgt Justin Kronenberg, spokesman for the Marine Corps Recruiting Command.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Similarly, the Navy said recruiters will practice all safety procedures but keep stations open at this point.

It met its goal in 2019, after failing to hit recruiting numbers a year earlier, for the first time in 13 years. The target goal for recruits was lowered from 76,500 in 2018 to about 68,000 last year.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Army leaders have increased the number of recruiters and beefed up efforts to connect with young people through online sports and similar events.</p>"]}

Tony Cardenas, the chairman of BOLD PAC \u2014 which represents the 37-member Congressional Hispanic Caucus and works to elect Latinos to Congress \u2014 said Biden was the first to meet with the group, and they believed that, if he were elected president, he would fight for the nation\u2019s millions of Latinos and people in the U.S. illegally.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe current public health crisis of COVID-19 has further exposed the lack of competence in the White House and the need \u2014 now more than ever \u2014 for an empathic, decisive, and experienced leader who will put science and facts before politics. Vice President Joe Biden has shown he can do just that,\u201d said Cardenas, D-Calif.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Biden holds an essentially insurmountable delegate lead over Sanders, his last remaining Democratic rival, but the Vermont senator remains in the race. The winner will face President Donald Trump in November\u2019s general election.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Biden had already racked up a handful of endorsements from prominent Latino elected officials, including Cardenas, who endorsed him in December. But the endorsement from the full group is the latest signal that Biden is making inroads among Latinos, a constituency that\u2019s shown strong support for Sanders and helped drive some of his early primary successes.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Sanders made Latino outreach a centerpiece of his 2020 presidential campaign in many states, holding Spanish-language organizing and campaign events.

Also, fewer Americans are heading south because of a statewide stay-at-home order in California and a State Department warning advising Americans not to travel abroad.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Still, the restrictions are a major development along the world\u2019s most heavily crossed border. Mexican shoppers are the lifeblood of smaller U.S. border towns, and it is common for people in both countries to cross frequently to visit family and friends.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As news of the ban spread, people like 68-year-old El Paso resident Silvia Shadden rushed to cross even if her reason could meet the definition of essential.

American citizens and permanent legal residents would still be allowed to return to the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe want to make sure that cargo continues, trade continues, heath care workers continue to be able to traverse that border,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cBut tourism, some recreational activities and other things needs to stop during this crisis.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump said the border restrictions and the plan to immediately return anyone detained while illegally crossing are intended to curb the spread of the virus in detention facilities as well as a \u201cmass global migration that would badly deplete the health care resources needed for our people.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The measure to quickly turn back migrants would include those crossing illegally into the United States as well as into Canada, where some people have fled to escape U.S. enforcement efforts.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Ebrard, reacting to reports that the U.S. planned to send people from elsewhere into his country, including asylum seekers, said Mexico would only accept the return of migrants from his country and Central America.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump said Friday that the U.S. would send non-Mexicans \u201cback to their own countries, not to Mexico.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wolf said the U.S. would send people back to their homelands but was also \u201cworking with Mexico to send additional populations back there as well.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security did not address the apparent contradiction.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump also said that Mexico would suspend flights from Europe.

The U.S. accounts for about 75% of Mexican exports, including autos, computers and medical devices.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Even with the exceptions, it\u2019s a major blow to border economies. An average of 40,000 cars enter the U.S. daily from Tijuana, Mexico, at the busiest crossing in San Diego, which has a second crossing that funnels about 19,000 cars a day. About 30,000 cars enter El Paso daily from Ciudad Juarez. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The State Department on Thursday issued a new travel alert urging Americans not to go abroad under any circumstances and to return home if they are already abroad unless they plan to remain overseas.
