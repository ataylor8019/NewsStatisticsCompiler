Hart has a collection of red, orange and white angular shapes on hers.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">They\u2019re two of the four founders of the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thedazzleclub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Dazzle Club</a><!-- -->, a group of artists set up last year to provoke discussion about the growing using of facial recognition technology.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The group holds monthly silent walks through different parts of London to raise awareness about the technology, which they say is being used for \u201crampant surveillance.\u201d Other concerns include its lack of regulation, inaccuracy and how it affects public spaces.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some 19 people attended the most recent event in the East London neighborhood of Shoreditch, and anyone can take part in the walks, in which participants have to paint their faces in a style called CV Dazzle.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The technique, developed by artist and researcher <a href=\"https://cvdazzle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Adam Harvey</a><!-- -->, is aimed at camouflaging against facial detection systems, which turn images of faces into mathematical formulas that can be analyzed by algorithms. CV Dazzle - where CV is short for computer vision - uses cubist-inspired designs to thwart the computer, said Rowlands.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cYou\u2019re trying to kind of scramble that by applying these kind of random colors and patterns,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most important is having light and dark colors. So we often go for blacks and whites, very contrasting colors, because you\u2019re trying to mess with the shadows and highlights of your face.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A similar technique was used extensively in World War I to camouflage British naval ships and confuse opponents about the actual heading or location of the ships.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">To test that their designs work, they use the simple face detection feature on their smartphone cameras. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI can see that I\u2019m hidden, it\u2019s not detecting me,\u201d Rowlands said, checking her phone to see her face doesn\u2019t have a square around it.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The rise of facial recognition technology is being tested and spreading in developed democracies after aggressive use in some more authoritarian countries like China. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Britain has long been used to surveillance cameras in public spaces to counter security threats, and London is ranked as having one of the world\u2019s highest concentrations of closed-circuit television cameras. But that acceptance is being tested as authorities and corporations increasingly seek to deploy a new generation of cameras with facial recognition technology while activists, lawmakers and independent experts raise concerns about mass surveillance, privacy, and accuracy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Opposition to algorithmic surveillance is not limited to Britain. Russia activists were reportedly arrested last month for holding a similar face paint protest over Moscow\u2019s facial recognition cameras. Hong Kong pro-democracy activists routinely use face masks in street protests to hide their identities. Rights groups in Serbia and Uganda have opposed government projects to install Chinese-supplied cameras.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Other designers have come up with countermeasures like sunglasses that reflect infrared light to blind cameras.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThere is a movement of resistance against facial recognition that we are actively participating in and we want to kind of further initiate,\u201d said Rowlands.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Rowlands, Hart and two other artists founded the Dazzle Club in August, following news that London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district \u2014 a busy transport hub where many big offices are being built rapidly \u2014 had quietly experimented with live facial recognition cameras without public knowledge or consent, sparking a backlash.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">London police recently started using live facial recognition cameras on operational deployments. Last week officers arrested a woman wanted for assault after the cameras picked her out of a street crowd on a busy shopping street. Police say new technology is needed to keep the public safe and images of innocent people are deleted immediately. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Public attitudes to facial recognition technology in Britain appear to be mixed, according to one survey last year, which found most people said they don\u2019t know enough about it but nearly half said they should be able to opt out. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Dazzle Club\u2019s founders say they\u2019re worried about the effect that the technology has on people in public if cameras are collecting their biometric data \u2014 facial images \u2014 without clearly explaining what\u2019s being done with it.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe\u2019re having to adjust our behavior in public space in a way that I think is problematic,\u201d said Hart.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Read more AP stories on developments in technology at <a class=\"\" href=\"/apf-technology\">https://apnews.com/apf-technology</a></p>"]}

But the company already stores its programs on servers close to users\u2019 homes already, and there\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s clogging networks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">IF THE INTERNET IS SO STURDY, WHY DOES MY HOME CONNECTION STUTTER?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The problem partly lies in the so-called \u201clast mile,\u201d the link that connects your home to the ultra-high speed internet backbone.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Most U.S. homes get their internet from cable companies and thus connect to the broader network via coaxial cable, a legacy of the cable TV era. These connections provide faster \u201cdownstream\u201d speeds to your home than \u201cupstream\u201d speeds back to the internet. Since videoconferencing sends equal amounts of data both ways, simultaneous sessions can clog the upstream channel and disrupt service for the entire household.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">If that happens, one quick solution is to have some family members switch to audio-only, which conserves bandwidth. This also applies to anyone in multiplayer online games, where \u2014 per a wag on Twitter \u2014 the banter between players often resembles conference calls with occasional shooting.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">You could also order a service upgrade, although that might not be strictly necessary. Some providers are temporarily offering more bandwidth, particularly for families with school-age children, in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Others have dropped service caps that charge extra when data usage passes a certain threshold. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The relatively few U.S. households with their own direct fiber-optic connections have the same bandwidth in both directions and shouldn\u2019t experience serious hiccups.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">DOES MY HOME NETWORK NEED AN UPGRADE?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It might. Start with your internet modem, the device that most likely has a coax cable connecting it to your wall. Your internet provider often rents the modem to you.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">If it\u2019s several years old, it\u2019s probably time to ask your provider if upgrading the modem\u2019s internal software, or replacing the modem entirely, will help. Older modems often can\u2019t deliver the full bandwidth you\u2019re paying for to your household. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Next up is your Wi-Fi router. If you have cable, it may be built into your modem. If you haven\u2019t already, try moving it to a more central location in your home or apartment; that will ensure bandwidth is distributed more equally.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Or you can add more access points and distribute Wi-Fi with a \u201cmesh\u201d network.

But Americans held captive at home by the coronavirus can turn to Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other streaming services, outliers in an entertainment industry brought to an unprecedented standstill.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The recent launch of Disney and Apple services and the upcoming arrival of NBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock and WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max unleashed speculation about winners and losers in an increasingly crowded field. With self-imposed or required isolation the abrupt reality, emerging and niche streamers could draw new subscribers \u2014 gains that may even outlast the coronavirus crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The viral outbreak \u201chas caused so much pain across industries globally,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. \u201cYet on the streaming side, the demand for those services is going to increase exponentially over the next three to six months\u201d as consumers around the world remain stuck in place.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Up to a 20 percent increase is likely in the amount of time subscribers spend watching streamed fare, and millions of new customers will hop aboard worldwide, Ives predicted.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Pay TV channels could benefit as well as more people become shut-ins and reconsider cutting the cord, slowing an accelerating trend, said analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak of Pivotal Research Group. Broadcast networks facing rating declines also could see a boost in viewership, he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Streaming companies are reacting to the moment in varied ways, but always carefully. Media companies want to be seen as good citizens who are serving up an antidote to anxiety over the virus and housebound boredom, not capitalizing on a disaster. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

The current monthly tabs range from the modest (Apple TV Plus, with its fledgling roster of shows is $5, Disney Plus is $7 for a deep bench of old and new fare) to Netflix\u2019s top-tier plan ($16, compared to $9 for basic access). </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Niche services are taking a different tack. Acorn TV, which offers British and international programming, expanded its free trial offer for new subscribers from a week to 30 days, as have its AMC Networks siblings Sundance Now, Shudder and Urban Movie Channel (UMC).</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAs the extent of the Covid-19 crisis became clear, we realized that a service like Acorn TV could make a meaningful difference in many people\u2019s lives, especially those who are facing prolonged isolation and potential economic hardship as a result of the virus,\u201d said Matthew Graham, the service\u2019s general manager. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\"><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/nbc-give-price-details-peacock-streaming-service-68328822\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Peacock\u2019s U.S. launch isn\u2019t until July</a><!-- -->, but with an upside for those with budget pressures: It will include a no-cost, ad-supported version, Peacock Free, with content including next-day access to new NBC shows and full seasons of older series.

Announcement of the technology rules was originally planned at a health care conference in Florida, but that event was canceled over coronavirus concerns. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The long-awaited rules could take several years for consumers and patients to start seeing the practical effects. They are intended to get at one of the major problems with electronic health records: the systems of hospitals and doctors often don\u2019t \u2018talk\u2019 to each other, and patients struggle to get their medical information digitally transmitted, defaulting to CDs and faxed paper records.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The federal government invested more than $30 billion a decade ago to help hospitals and doctors convert to computerized records. But it never solved the problems of getting the different medical systems to seamlessly interact, and of providing a pathway for patients to easily access their records. Two rules finalized by the Trump administration aim to finally fix that.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The regulations are highly complex. Hospitals and a consumer group objected, saying that patient privacy would be undermined.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">One rule from the HHS agency that oversees health care technology would implement congressional requirements that hospitals and other health care entities put a stop to practices that can block the digital transfer of information. Some systems don\u2019t allow screen shots or video to be shared, for example.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The health care technology office rule also tries to address access problems at the patient\u2019s level. It requires hospitals and other health care service providers to allow access to records via software used by smartphone apps, such as the ones that already handle banking and credit card transactions. Patients could literally access their records via the smartphone in their back pocket.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A companion rule from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would require health plans in Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, \u201cObamacare\u201d and the children\u2019s health insurance program to give patients access to their information through apps compatible with smartphones.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">CMS will also require hospitals to electronically notify a patient\u2019s outside doctors when that patient is admitted, discharged or transferred.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The hope is that easier access and authorized sharing of individuals\u2019 health care information will help prevent medical errors, cut down on duplicative tests, and help patients become smarter consumers of health care services.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Rick Pollack, president of the American Hospital Association, said a new generation of health care apps could put the personal information of patients at risk, since the app developers would not be required to meet the same legal standards for privacy that are imposed on hospitals. \u201cThis could lead to third party apps using personal health information in ways in which patients are unaware,\u201d Pollack said in a statement. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen also criticized the new rules, saying they fail to guarantee that sensitive information won\u2019t fall into the hands of third parties that could exploit it for profit.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">CMS says it intends improve on health care privacy standards in the smart phone industry to provide consumers with a higher level of protection.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In addition to Azar, among the top administration officials joining to make the announcement were White House health policy chief Joe Grogan, CMS Administrator Seema Verma, and Donald Rucker, the government\u2019s National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The administration\u2019s plan had been to make the announcement at a global health technology conference sponsored by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society in Orlando this week.

The Associated Press works with Facebook as a third-party fact checker.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The episode highlights the challenges social media companies face in containing the rapid spread of misleading information and raises questions about how prepared the companies are for a likely onslaught of disinformation during the 2020 campaign. It also underscores that trafficking in misinformation is not limited to one political party: Both Sanders\u2019 and Trump\u2019s backers aggressively promoted the unsubstantiated notion that Biden is in cognitive decline.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis is the worst kind of misinformation \u2014 it can impact a presidential election, and it\u2019s being shared by the president with millions of followers,\u201d said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who studies disinformation and social media. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot more of it, and we need the platforms to get this right.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">All in their 70s, Biden, Sanders and Trump have faced questions about their stamina or mental acumen, though each has produced letters from physicians attesting to his fitness for office. Sanders \u2014 who, like Biden, would be the oldest president ever elected \u2014 suffered a heart attack last year. Biden has long had a penchant for verbal miscues throughout his political career. And Trump has directly tried to combat questions about his mental fitness, tweeting in 2018 that he is a \u201cvery stable genius.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The unproven claims about Biden\u2019s fitness for office have emerged from the left and right with increasing frequency following the former vice president\u2019s sweeping victories during last week\u2019s Super Tuesday contests. And they accelerated after Biden returned to the campaign trail on Saturday with a brief speech in St. Louis. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, pointedly noted on Twitter that his 78-year-old boss had three campaign events on his schedule that day, \u201ceach speaking engagement extending for close to an hour.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Later in the day, Trump tweeted a misleadingly edited video clip from Biden\u2019s 15-minute stump speech in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">During the speech, Biden appeared to stumble over his words when he said: \u201cWe cannot win this reelection -- excuse me, we can only reelect Donald Trump if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Conservative and pro-Trump social media accounts first seized on the gaffe Saturday evening, sharing a fuller clip. But White House social media director Dan Scavino later shared a further edited version in which Biden appears to say: \u201cWe can only reelect Donald Trump.\u201d Trump retweeted Scavino\u2019s post.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Different versions of the video were quickly shared by Twitter accounts affiliated with Trump\u2019s campaign Saturday night over a three-hour period, noted Gideon Blocq, the CEO of VineSight, a tech company that surfaces misinformation online.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Combined, the various versions of the edited clip were watched more than 10 million times by Monday afternoon. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Biden campaign responded to the video with incredulity and noted that the former vice president has kept up a whirlwind schedule in recent weeks.

They had argued that eliminating a major wireless company would harm consumers by reducing competition and adding billions of dollars to phone bills.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The companies said the deal would benefit consumers by helping the companies build a better next-generation, <a class=\"\" href=\"/6a570e0ef80c4bf28d49a66757b8bdd3\">5G wireless network </a><!-- --> than each could do alone. The companies also said the deal would lead to lower prices, as they can better compete with the now-larger AT&amp;T and Verizon. A federal judge in New York sided with the companies in February. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">New York decided a few days later not to appeal.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Becerra said Wednesday that T-Mobile would reimburse the remaining 12 states and the District of Columbia up to $15 million combined for the costs of investigating and litigating the antitrust case. He did not say how much the states spent.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the settlement, T-Mobile also agreed to additional price and job protections in California beyond the deals struck with federal regulators, as the company has done in individual settlements with such states as Colorado and Texas, both of which left the state coalition before the trial began. It will freeze prices for five years for Californians rather than three years at the national level, for example. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The California settlement also requires T-Mobile to do what the company already said it would in a <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/news/supercharged-uncarrier-moves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">November announcement</a><!-- --> \u2014 offer free internet service and Wi-Fi hotspots to 10 million low-income households with kids nationwide.

As part of its deal with the federal government, T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to set up satellite TV company Dish as a new cellular competitor, though it will be a much smaller one. The states had argued that Dish was not an adequate replacement for Sprint in the wireless market.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The California Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday issued a proposal approving the deal, with conditions including backup power in emergencies.

{"title": "Gadgets for tech giants made with coerced Uighur labor", "articleDate": "March 7, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By DAKE KANG and YANAN WANG", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">NANCHANG, China (AP) \u2014 In a lively Muslim quarter of Nanchang city, a sprawling Chinese factory turns out computer screens, cameras and fingerprint scanners for a supplier to international tech giants such as Apple and Lenovo. Throughout the neighborhood, women in headscarves stroll through the streets, and Arabic signs advertise halal supermarkets and noodle shops.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Yet the mostly Muslim ethnic Uighurs who labor in the factory are isolated within a walled compound that is fortified with security cameras and guards at the entrance. Their forays out are limited to rare chaperoned trips, they are not allowed to worship or cover their heads, and they must attend special classes in the evenings, according to former and current workers and shopkeepers in the area.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The connection between OFILM, the supplier that owns the Nanchang factory, and the tech giants is the latest sign that companies outside China are benefiting from coercive labor practices imposed on the Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group, and other minorities. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Over the past four years, the Chinese government has detained more than a million people from the far west Xinjiang region, most of them Uighurs, in internment camps and prisons where they go through <a class=\"\" href=\"/6e151296fb194f85ba69a8babd972e4b/China%E2%80%99s-massindoctrinationcamps-evoke-Cultural-Revolution\">forced ideological and behavioral re-education</a><!-- -->. China has long suspected the Uighurs of harboring separatist tendencies because of their distinct culture, language and religion.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">When detainees \u201cgraduate\u201d from the camps, documents show, <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">many are sent to work in factories</a><!-- -->. A dozen Uighurs and Kazakhs told the AP they knew people who were sent by the state to work in factories in China\u2019s east, known as inner China \u2014 some from the camps, some plucked from their families, some from vocational schools. Most were sent by force, although in a few cases it wasn\u2019t clear if they consented. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Workers are often enrolled in classes where state-sponsored teachers give lessons in Mandarin, China\u2019s dominant language, or politics and \u201cethnic unity.\u201d Conditions in the jobs vary in terms of pay and restrictions.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the OFILM factory, Uighurs are paid the same as other workers but otherwise treated differently, according to residents of the neighborhood. They are not allowed to leave or pray \u2013 unlike the Hui Muslim migrants also working there, who are considered less of a threat by the Chinese government.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThey don\u2019t let them worship inside,\u201d said a Hui Muslim woman who worked in the factory for several weeks alongside the Uighurs. \u201cThey don\u2019t let them come out.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf you\u2019re Uighur, you\u2019re only allowed outside twice a month,\u201d a small business owner who spoke with the workers confirmed. The AP is not disclosing the names of those interviewed near the factory out of concern for possible retribution. \u201cThe government chose them to come to OFILM, they didn\u2019t choose it.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Chinese government says the labor program is a way to train Uighurs and other minorities and give them jobs. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday called concern over possible coerced labor under the program \u201cgroundless\u201d and \u201cslander.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">However, experts say that like the internment camps, the program is part of a broader assault on the Uighur culture, <a class=\"\" href=\"/903a97b7c62a47b98553b6f422827dd7/China-treats-Uighur-kids-as-'orphans'-after-parents-seized\">breaking up social and family links</a><!-- --> by sending people far from their homes to be assimilated into the dominant Han Chinese culture.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThey think these people are poorly educated, isolated, backwards, can\u2019t speak Mandarin,\u201d said James Leibold, a scholar of Chinese ethnic policy at La Trobe University in Melbourne. \u201cSo what do you do? You \u2018educate\u2019 them, you find ways to transform them in your own image. Bringing them into the Han Chinese heartland is a way to turbocharge this transformation.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">OFILM\u2019s website indicates the Xinjiang workers make screens, camera cover lenses and fingerprint scanners. It touts customers including Apple, Samsung, Lenovo, Dell, HP, LG and Huawei, although there was no way for the AP to track specific products to specific companies. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Apple\u2019s most recent <a href=\"link:%20https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple-Supplier-List.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">list of suppliers</a><!-- -->, published January last year, includes three OFILM factories in Nanchang. It\u2019s unclear whether the specific OFILM factory the AP visited twice in Nanchang supplies Apple, but it has the same address as one listed. Another OFILM factory is located about half a mile away on a different street. Apple did not answer repeated requests for clarification on which factory it uses.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In an email, Apple said its code of conduct requires suppliers to \u201cprovide channels that encourage employees to voice concerns.\u201d It said it interviews the employees of suppliers during annual assessments in their local language without their managers present, and had done 44,000 interviews in 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Lenovo confirmed that it sources screens, cameras, and fingerprint scanners from OFILM but said it was not aware of the allegations and would investigate. Lenovo also pointed to a 2018 audit by the Reliable Business Alliance in which OFILM scored very well.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">All the companies that responded said they required suppliers to follow strict labor standards. LG and Dell said they had \u201cno evidence\u201d of forced labor in their supply chains but would investigate, as did Huawei. HP did not respond.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">OFILM also lists as customers dozens of companies within China, as well as international companies it calls \u201cpartners\u201d without specifying what product it offers. And it supplies PAR Technology, an American sales systems vendor to which it most recently shipped 48 cartons of touch screens in February, according to U.S. customs data obtained through <a href=\"https://www.importgenius.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">ImportGenius</a><!-- --> and Panjiva, which track shipping data. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">PAR Technology in turn says it supplies terminals to major chains such as McDonald\u2019s, Taco Bell, and Subway. However, the AP was unable to confirm that products from OFILM end up with the fast food companies.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">McDonald\u2019s said it has asked PAR Technology to discontinue purchases from OFILM while it launches an immediate investigation. PAR Technology also said it would investigate immediately. Subway and Taco Bell did not respond.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\"><a href=\"https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">A report Sunday from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute</a><!-- -->, researched separately from the AP, estimated that more than 80,000 Uighurs were transferred from Xinjiang to factories across China between 2017 and 2019. The report said it found \u201cconditions that strongly suggest forced labor\u201d consistent with International Labor Organization definitions.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The AP also reported a year ago that <a class=\"\" href=\"/99016849cddb4b99a048b863b52c28cb\">Uighur forced labor was being used within Xinjiang</a><!-- --> to make sportswear that ended up in the U.S. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">FROM FARMERS TO FACTORY WORKERS</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Beijing first sent Uighurs to work in inland China in the early 2000s, as part of a broad effort to push minorities to adopt urban lifestyles and integrate with the Han Chinese majority to tighten political control.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At first the program targeted young, single women, because the state worried that Uighur women raised in pious Muslim families didn\u2019t work, had children early and refused to marry Han men. But as stories of poor pay and tight restrictions trickled back, police began threatening some parents with jail time if they didn\u2019t send their children, six Uighurs told the AP.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The program was halted in 2009, when at least two Uighurs died in a brawl with Han workers at a toy factory in coastal Guangdong province. After peaceful protests in Xinjiang were met with police fire, <a class=\"\" href=\"/1e095c203d4a40c0a79d78d1a41634ab\">ethnic riots broke out that killed an estimated 200 people</a><!-- -->, mostly Han Chinese civilians.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">An AP review of Chinese academic papers and state media reports shows that officials blamed the failure of the labor program on the Uighurs\u2019 language and culture. So when the government ramped up the program again after the ascent of hardline Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2012, it emphasized ideological transformation.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A paper drafted by the head of the Xinjiang statistics bureau in 2014 said the Uighurs\u2019 poor Mandarin made it hard for them to integrate in inner China. It concluded that Xinjiang\u2019s rural minorities needed to be broken away from traditional lifestyles and systematically \u201cdisciplined\u201d, \u201ctrained\u201d and \u201cinstilled with modern values.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe local saturated religious atmosphere and the long-time living habits of ethnic minorities are incompatible with the requirements of modern industrial production,\u201d the paper said. It outlined a need to \u201cslowly correct misunderstandings about going out to choose jobs.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Before Uighurs were transferred for jobs, the paper continued, they needed to be trained and assessed on their living habits and adoption of corporate culture. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThose who fail will not be exported,\u201d it said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The paper also described government incentives such as tax breaks and subsidies for Chinese companies to take Uighurs. A 2014 draft contract for Xinjiang laborers in Guangdong province obtained by the AP shows the government there offered companies 3000 RMB ($428.52) per worker, with an additional 1000 RMB ($142.84) for \u201ctraining\u201d each person for no less than 60 class hours. In exchange, companies had to offer \u201cconcentrated accommodation areas,\u201d halal canteens and \u201cethnic unity education and training.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But it was a tough sell at a time when Chinese officials were grappling with knifings, bombings and car attacks by Uighurs, fueled by explosive anger at the government\u2019s harsh security measures and religious restrictions. Hundreds died in race-related violence in Xinjiang, both Uighur and Han Chinese.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A labor agent who only gave his surname, Zhang, said he tried brokering deals to send Xinjiang workers to factories in the eastern city of Hangzhou, but finding companies willing to take Uighurs was a challenge, especially in a slowing economy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cTheir work efficiency is not high,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The size of the program is considerable. A November 2017 state media report said Hotan prefecture alone planned to send 20,000 people over two years to work in inner China.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There, the report said, they would \u201crealize the dreams of their lives.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">ANSWERING THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S CALL</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Uighurs at OFLIM were sent there as part of the government\u2019s labor program, in an arrangement the company\u2019s website calls a \u201cschool-enterprise cooperative.\u201d OFILM describes the workers as migrants organized by the government or vocational school students on \u201cinternships\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">OFILM confirmed it received AP requests for comment but did not reply.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The AP was unable to get inside the facility, and on one visit to Nanchang, plainclothes police tailed AP journalists by car and on foot. But posts on the company website extoll OFILM\u2019s efforts to accommodate their Uighur workers with Mandarin and politics classes six days a week, along with halal food.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">OFILM first hired Uighurs in 2017, recruiting over 3,000 young men and women in Xinjiang. They bring the Uighurs on one- or two-year contracts to Nanchang, a southeastern metropolis nearly two thousand miles from Xinjiang that local officials hope to turn into a tech hub. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">OFILM is one of Nanchang\u2019s biggest employers, with half a dozen factory complexes sprinkled across the city and close ties with the state. Investment funds backed by the Nanchang city government own large stakes in OFILM, corporate filings show. The Nanchang government told the AP that OFILM recruits minorities according to \u201cvoluntary selection by both parties\u201d and provides equal pay along with personal and religious freedom.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">OFILM\u2019s website says the company \u201canswered the government\u2019s call\u201d and went to Xinjiang to recruit minorities. The Uighurs need training, OFILM says, to pull them from poverty and help them \u201cstudy and improve.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Mandarin is heavily emphasized, the site says, as well as lessons in history and \u201cethnic unity\u201d to \u201ccomprehensively improve their overall quality.\u201d The site features pictures of Uighurs playing basketball on factory grounds, dancing in a canteen and vying in a Mandarin speech competition.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In August, when OFILM organized celebrations for Eid Qurban, a major Islamic festival, Uighur employees did not pray at a mosque. Instead, they dressed in orange uniforms and gathered in a basketball court for a show with Communist officials called \u201cLove the Motherland \u2013 Thank the Party.\u201d An OFILM post said a \u201cUighur beauty\u201d dazzled with her \u201cbeautiful exotic style.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">State media reports portray the Nanchang factory workers as rural and backwards before the Communist Party trained them, a common perception of the Uighurs among the Han Chinese.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe workers\u2019 concept of time was hazy, they would sleep in till whenever they wanted,\u201d a Party official is quoted as saying in one. Now, he said, their \u201cconcept of time has undergone a total reversal.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the reports and OFILM posts, the Uighurs are portrayed as grateful to the Communist Party for sending them to inner China. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Despite the wan expressions of three OFILM workers from Lop County, a December 2017 report said they gave an \u201centhusiastic\u201d presentation about how they lived in clean new dormitories \u201cmuch better than home\u201d and were visited by Communist Party cadres.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe were overjoyed that leaders from the Lop County government still come to see us on holidays,\u201d one of the workers, Estullah Ali, was quoted as saying. \u201cMany of us were moved to tears.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">THEY TOOK MY CHILD TO INNER CHINA</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Minorities fleeing China describe a far grimmer situation. H., a wealthy jade merchant from Lop County, where OFILM now gets Uighur workers, began noticing the labor transfer program in 2014. That\u2019s when state propaganda blaring through television and loudspeakers urged young Uighurs to work in inner China. Officials hustled families to a labor transfer office where they were forced to sign contracts, under threat of land confiscations and prison sentences.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">H., identified only by the initial of his last name out of fear of retribution, was worried. The government was not only reviving the labor program but also clamping down on religion. Acquaintances vanished: Devout Muslims and language teachers, men with beards, women with headscarves.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Toward the end of 2015, when H. greeted his 72-year-old neighbor on the street, the man burst into tears.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThey took my child to inner China to work,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Months later, H. and his family fled China.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Zharqynbek Otan, a Chinese-born ethnic Kazakh, said that after he was released from an internment camp in 2018, neighbors in his home village also told him their sons and daughters were forced to sign contracts for 6 months to five years to work at factories near Shanghai. If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they\u2019d be taken straight back to internment camps.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nurlan Kokteubai, an ethnic Kazakh, said during his time in an internment camp, a cadre told him they selected young, strong people to work in inner Chinese factories in need of labor.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cHe told us that those young people would acquire vocational skills,\u201d Kokteubai said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Not all workers are subject to the restrictions at OFILM. One ethnic Kazakh said her brother made power banks in central China for $571.36 a month and didn\u2019t take classes.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But another said two of his cousins were forced to go and work in cold, harsh conditions. They were promised $428.52 a month but paid only $42.85. Though they wanted to quit, four Uighurs who complained were detained in camps after returning to Xinjiang, scaring others.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Uighurs and Kazakhs in exile say it\u2019s likely those working in inner China are still better off than those in camps or factories in Xinjiang, and that in the past, some had gone voluntarily to earn money. A former worker at Jiangxi Lianchuang Electronics, a lens maker in Nanchang, told The Associated Press the 300 or so Uighurs there were free to enter or leave their compound, although most live in dormitories inside factory grounds. He and a current worker said they were happy with their working conditions, their salary of about 5,000 RMB ($714.20) a month, and their teachers and Mandarin classes in the evenings.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But when presented a list of questions in Uighur about the labor transfers, the former Jiangxi Lianchuang worker started to look very nervous. He asked for the list, then set it on fire with a lighter and dropped it in an ashtray.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf the Communist Party hears this, then\u201d \u2013 he knocked his wrists together, mimicking a suspect being handcuffed. \u201cIt\u2019s very bad.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writer Erika Kinetz contributed to this report.</p>"]}
{"title": "Review: \u2018The Hunt\u2019 is a clunky swipe at a divided America ", "articleDate": "March 11, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By MARK KENNEDY", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fittingly, few films in recent memory arrive with a bigger target on its back than \u201cThe Hunt.\u201d Our quick advice? Lower your weapons. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The horror-thriller with a healthy side of political commentary was pulled from release last summer following backlash to its trailer depicting a group of wealthy, liberal Americans kidnapping and hunting down red-state stereotypes for fun. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some commentators \u2014 including the president of the United States \u2014 were quick to criticize the film in the wake of several mass shooting despite never seeing it, denouncing the notion of elitist Democrats brutally killing so-called \u201cdeplorables.\u201d And, to be sure, it does depict that. But anyone who actually watches the whole film will clearly be rooting for the deplorables. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It\u2019s not the Right but the Left that comes off far worse in \u201c <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowGYbxTPgU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">The Hunt</a><!-- -->.\u201d The hunters are smug, NPR-listening, kimono-wearing, caviar-eating, anti-gun killers who seek approval on Twitter from Ava DuVernay and hide their venality in humanitarian causes. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cFor the record, climate change is real!\u201d one liberal screams at a prone victim before smashing his head open. Drinking a full sugar soda is anathema for this group, who are finicky and smug. \u201cWho has the hand sanitizer?\u201d one asks while waiting to kill fellow Americans.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Right-wingers are mocked as well, to be sure. One character brings up the \u201cdeep state\u201d and is convinced that a group of migrants he encounters includes \u201ccrisis babies.\u201d Sean Hannity gets name-checked by another.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The script was written by Damon Lindelof, who created \u201cWatchmen\u201d and \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d and Nick Cuse, a writer on both projects. Craig Zobel, who directed the post-apocalyptic survivalist tale \u201cZ for Zachariah,\u201d takes the helm. Originally scheduled to be released in September, the film comes out now as political winds are blowing ever stronger. It really isn\u2019t sturdy enough not to be ripped to shreds.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The filmmakers have created an uneasy and often awkward mix of murderous violence and social commentary, with one element often stepping on the other. Not many films can combine George Orwell references and a vicious stabbing with a meat thermometer. It\u2019s all as subtle as a bear trap.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">When the dust settles, \u201cThe Hunt\u201d really stars Betty Gilpin (from Netflix\u2019s \u201cGLOW\u201d) and Hilary Swank (\u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d). Each represent opposite sides of the political divide. Both are smart, dangerous and resourceful.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The film starts with a dozen people waking up in what appears to be a central Arkansas clearing, deposited there by ruthless, urban sophisticates. They\u2019ve been drugged and gagged and soon they are armed, presumably to make the hunt more exciting.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The victims bear all the markings of boilerplate blue-collar red-staters \u2014 mom jeans, work boots and vet caps, everyone grizzled and unfashionable. \u201cWe need to lean into the stereotype,\u201d one character says during the movie and the filmmakers have done that in spades.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Most members of the hunted group never learn each other\u2019s names and you shouldn\u2019t get too attached either. To put it another way, actors Emma Roberts, Justin Hartley, Ike Barinholtz and Sturgill Simpson were probably paid by the hour.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Mayhem ensues as the group is picked off one by one, until Gilpin\u2019s character emerges as the film\u2019s gutsy heroine and takes the film by the scruff of its neck. \u201cThe Hunt\u201d later ham-handedly tries to explain why the dozen victims were selected and then switches to the viewpoint of the six hunters, who \u2014 thanks to a calm and efficient Gilpin \u2014 are becoming the hunted.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The concept of hunting humans for sport has a long history, stretching back to Richard Connell\u2019s 1924 short story \u201cThe Most Dangerous Game.\u201d It\u2019s reliable grist for movies exploring the divide between rich and poor, most recently in \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d franchise and last year\u2019s \u201cReady or Not.\u201d This time, the divide is exacerbated by the left-right divide the movie itself has added.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A satirical feature film is hard to pull off and the filmmakers here have learned that a trailer for a satirical film is even harder. The balancing act is subtle for both and context is crucial. Jonathan Swift, one of the best at poking fun at society, called satire a tricky mirror where you see what you want: \u201cSatire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody\u2019s face but their own.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe Hunt\u201d is not great satire or even a great film. It\u2019s an unstylish and heavy-handed horror-thriller that turns into a revenge gore-fest as it mocks everyone with a big clumsy paw. It balks at making any grand conclusions about the state of America or how to heal our divisions, unless there\u2019s a message in the red-state character played by Gilpin cauterizing her torso wound with a high-end, blue-state kitchen torch.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Toward the end, \u201cThe Hunt\u201d warns us to be careful not to jump to conclusions about others or believe in dark internet conspiracies. That\u2019s supremely ironic, given what happened to this film. Anyway, it\u2019s too late. These are not healthy days for satire, no matter how clownish. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe Hunt,\u201d a Universal Pictures release, is rated R for strong bloody violence and language throughout.

It also has the potential to win support from lawmakers in greater Minnesota, who have recently raised equity concerns about electric vehicles.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">\u201cThe report\u2019s clear conclusion is there are many resources that will play a role in decarbonizing transportation and we\u2019ll get a lot farther with this approach,\u201d said Brendan Jordan, vice president of Great Plains Institute, which convened the group and produced the white paper.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">The paper is the result of a two-year process funded by the Bernard and Anne Spitzer Charitable Trust, the MacArthur Foundation, and the McKnight Foundation.

Calculations would be based on a carbon-accounting model developed at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">State policymakers would set a target \u2014 the paper says up to 20% by 2030 is achievable using resources in the region \u2014 and fuel companies would have to meet that target by purchasing credits from low-carbon fuel producers.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Clean energy advocates still see electrification as the best path to eliminating carbon emissions from transportation, but that transition will take decades and the model proposed in the paper could help clarify biofuel\u2019s role until then.

While Netanyahu has defended the moves as extraordinary steps in extraordinary times, his opponents accuse him of undermining Israel\u2019s democratic foundations in a desperate bid to cement his grip on power and derail a looming criminal trial after coming up short in parliamentary elections this month.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe state of Israel must do two very important things right now: Deal with the coronavirus crisis from its health, economic and social perspective and at the same time preserve Israeli democracy,\u201d Benny Gantz, his opponent and leader of the Blue and White Party, told Israeli Channel 12 TV. \u201cWe need to be very careful not to even approach the margins of dictatorship.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In this month\u2019s election, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party emerged as the largest single party in the Knesset, or parliament. But with his smaller religious and nationalist parties, he controls only 58 seats, three short of a majority required to form a government. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Gantz has the backing of 61 lawmakers, and under Israeli custom, was tapped this week by the country\u2019s president to try to form a new government. The former military chief has one month to complete the task. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the meantime, he is eager to push through a series of bills that could end Netanyahu\u2019s career by imposing term limits and banning an indicted politician from serving as prime minister.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The coronavirus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 220,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 10,000.

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Israeli health officials have diagnosed nearly 700 coronavirus cases, with a sharp spike in the past two days.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The crisis has given Netanyahu the opportunity to flaunt his legendary leadership skills and, critics say, to thwart Gantz from moving forward with his agenda. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nearly every evening, Netanyahu gives a televised address, sternly telling the nation that he is imposing tough new restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus. He has ordered people to stay indoors, ordered tens of thousands of people into home quarantine and virtually sealed its borders.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Thursday\u2019s address, he said he was further tightening restrictions on movement, with exceptions only to go out for food or other urgent matters. \u201cYou must stay home. It\u2019s no longer a request,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While other countries have taken similar steps, some of his decisions have been unprecedented. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Citing the coronavirus crisis, his hand-picked justice minister all but closed the court system in a middle-of-the-night order just two days before Netanyahu\u2019s trial on corruption charges was to begin.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In another overnight move, Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet authorized the Shin Bet security agency to use phone-tracking technology to retrace the movements of infected people and identify those who had come into contact with them. The technology had previously only been used as a surveillance tool against Palestinian targets. The decision was blasted by opposition politicians and civil rights groups as a violation of privacy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Then, on Wednesday, Parliament Speaker Yuli Edelstein abruptly suspended activities at the Knesset, preventing Gantz\u2019s allies from forming key committees to press ahead with their legislative agenda. Edelstein cited procedural issues, but critics accused him of working on behalf of Netanyahu. Edelstein has rejected the charges and vowed to reconvene the Knesset on Monday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dan Meridor, a former justice minister and one-time member of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet, said that Netanyahu\u2019s recent decisions were not \u201cwell considered.\u201d He said even if such steps are justifiable responses to the coronavirus, the decision making was flawed because the government\u2019s traditional checks and balances, such as parliamentary oversight and an active court system, were not functioning.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cEven in a time of crisis, one should not lose the basic structure of the government,\u201d Meridor said. \u201cHe still has to remember that he\u2019s not a ruler of a country.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Israel does not have a formal constitution, but instead has a series of \u201cBasic Laws\u201d that serve as a de facto constitution.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Meridor said the situation had not yet reached a crisis stage, but said a huge test would be whether Edelstein keeps his word to reconvene the Knesset on Monday. If he finds new excuses to prevent it from functioning, \u201cthen we are in deep crisis,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Edelstein rejected the public uproar and said he was committed to reconvening parliament. \u201cThe Knesset isn\u2019t closed. Democracy isn\u2019t in danger,\u201d he told Channel 12 TV.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Earlier Thursday, hundreds of people gathered outside the Knesset, defying government restrictions on large gatherings to protest the shutdown. Some held signs that said \u201cNo to dictatorship,\u201d \u201cDemocracy in danger\u201d and calling Netanyahu the \u201ccrime minister.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Police arrested three people for violating a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people. They also blocked a convoy of dozens of cars from entering Jerusalem to protest, and dozens of other motorists inside Jerusalem from approaching the Knesset building. Many cars honked and hung black flags out their windows.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe need to remember the foundation upon which this country was built,\u201d said protester Michal Levi. \u201cWe have only one country. That\u2019s it. Don\u2019t give up on it.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the nearby Supreme Court, civil rights groups filed a challenge to the new phone-tracking tactics, claiming they amounted to an illegal violation of privacy. In a victory for the civil rights groups, the court ordered parliament to appoint its relevant oversight committees by Tuesday. Otherwise, the government will have to stop the phone surveillance.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hovering over all of the developments have been Netanyahu\u2019s legal troubles. He has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals in which he is accused of accepting expensive gifts and offering favors to media moguls in exchange for positive press coverage. Netanyahu denies the charges.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Netanyahu is desperate to stay in office throughout his trial, using his position to rail against what he sees as hostile police, prosecutors and media.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Israel Democracy Institute, an independent think tank that conducts research and gives advice to the government, issued a letter urging Edelstein to convene parliament immediately.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Yochanan Plesner, the institute\u2019s president, said Netanyahu appeared to be using stalling tactics to narrow Gantz\u2019s limited one-month window to push ahead the anti-Netanyahu legislation.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a struggle over the democracy, although it has democratic implications. It\u2019s a struggle over time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to erode the period of Gantz, his mandate and to ensure that he doesn\u2019t gain control over the Knesset and promote unfavorable legislation.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg and Alon Bernstein contributed.</p>"]}

That said, we cannot surrender transparency and oversight,\u201d said Gantz, Netanyahu\u2019s chief rival in the elections. \u201cA functional parliament, even and especially in states of emergency, is a hallmark of democracy and we will be steadfast in preserving it.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Netanyahu rejected the comments, saying that delaying the deployment of the measures could \u201clead to the deaths of a great many Israelis.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The new coronavirus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 195,000 people worldwide and killed more than 7,800. For most people, it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">More than 300 people have been diagnosed in Israel, with the number quickly rising, triggering fears that fatalities could soon follow as experts predict many more difficult weeks ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Netanyahu acknowledged the technology had never been used before on civilians and would involve a certain degree of violation of privacy. But he said the unprecedented health threat posed by the virus justified its use.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThese means will help us greatly in locating the ill and thus stopping the spread of the virus,\u201d he said in a televised announcement late Monday. \u201cWe will approve these digital tools for a limited period of 30 days. Israel is a democracy and we have to balance individual rights with the greater needs of all.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Among various other measures, Israeli health officials have put out public advisories ordering tens of thousands of people into protective home quarantine.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The new tactic looked to use mobile-phone tracking technology and a review of credit card data to give a far more precise history of an infected person\u2019s movements before they were diagnosed and identify people who might have been exposed. Those in jeopardy would then be notified by text message to self-quarantine.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The only other place believed to have used similar technology to fight the coronavirus pandemic is Taiwan, where the government used mobile phones to make sure infected people do not leave their quarantine. Netanyahu\u2019s office insisted the Shin Bet would not be involved in enforcing quarantine orders against sick patients and that all its actions would be shared with health authorities and overseen by legal experts.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Eugene Kontorovich, a law professor at George Mason University and director of international law at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum, said the Israeli measure was justified and legal and should serve as a model for the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cDuring this and other epidemics, the government has the right to curtail many fundamental liberties,\u201d he said. \u201cOne person\u2019s rights end where they begin to endanger others. This information is used to save lives, by finding people who have been unwittingly exposed and may be spreading disease.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Still, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court has agreed to hear a challenge over the move, which has sparked a heated debate over the use of sensitive security technology. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The lead editorial on Tuesday in the liberal Haaretz daily warned that the fight against the new virus in Israel was threatening individual rights.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe state should not determine the locations of law-abiding citizens, whose only crime is to be infected by the coronavirus,\u201d it wrote. \u201cIn emergency situations, governments have an even greater responsibility than usual not to violate the checks and balances that are the foundation of the democratic system.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">____</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Follow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

The event had been held in San Jose for the past few years.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Google and Facebook also canceled their flagship developers conferences in the face of coronavirus health concerns.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett told shareholders Friday that they won\u2019t be allowed to physically attend the company\u2019s May 2 annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, because of the coronavirus threat.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The <a class=\"\" href=\"/a4fa4834ff99d14b50434504370505d9\">virus has infected</a><!-- --> 137,000 people worldwide. Most patients have only mild or moderate symptoms, but the elderly and people with existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable. More than 5,000 have died. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Among other ways the virus is impacting businesses:</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">FLYING LOW: Delta is slashing its flying by 40% to handle an unprecedented nosedive in air travel demand. It\u2019s the largest cut in Delta\u2019s history. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">CEO Ed Bastian said the downturn in demand is unlike anything the company has ever seen, not even after the Sept. 11 attacks. He said he\u2019s optimistic about getting help from the White House and Congress. But, he said, Delta can\u2019t wait for Washington to act, so it is preserving cash and cutting costs.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Washington will consider aid for the airline industry. \u201cJust as after Sept. 11, we are very committed to make sure that our U.S. airlines have the ability and have the liquidity to get through this,\u201d Mnuchin told CNBC.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The federal government provided aid including loan guarantees to U.S. airlines after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when the number of people flying also dropped sharply.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">GETTING ONLINE: U.S. phone and cable companies say that they won\u2019t cut off home-internet and cellphone service for people and small businesses that are unable to pay because of the coronavirus pandemic, which is causing workplace shutdowns and layoffs. They\u2019ll also waive late fees and make their networks of Wi-Fi hotspots available to the public.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The companies acted at the request of Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, who is also encouraging \u2014 but not requiring \u2014 them to take further steps to make sure people can stay connected to each other, their schools, jobs and doctors as the country increasingly shuts down.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He suggested that the internet service providers increase and improve their low-cost internet offerings for low-income people, relax their data caps and try to help schools and libraries with remote learning, for example.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, has called on the FCC to do more to help families whose children\u2019s schools have shut down, like beefing up a program that helps schools loan Wi-Fi hotspots to kids stuck at home. The AP <a class=\"\" href=\"/7f263b8f7d3a43d6be014f860d5e4132\">has found that</a><!-- --> 3 million students have no internet access at home. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some companies are taking additional steps like those Pai suggested. Cable companies Comcast and Cox are boosting internet speeds on their low-cost plans and offering one or two months of free service for new low-income customers. AT&amp;T is waiving fees if people go over home-internet data caps. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The development comes as Ford and General Motors are asking white collar employees to work from home if possible, starting Monday. Factory workers for both companies still must report. Fiat Chrysler says it\u2019s accelerating deployment of remote working.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">AT THE MOVIES: AMC Theaters and Regal Cinemas, the country\u2019s two largest movie theater chains, plan to fill <a class=\"\" href=\"/3ca84b3aff2a2435753536ee140f8882\">their theaters</a><!-- --> no more than 50%. AMC said it would begin the policy Saturday and keep it until the end of April to help facilitate social distancing. In larger auditoriums, the chain will no longer sell more than 250 tickets for a showing.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Meanwhile, The Walt Disney Co. says its shutting down many of its live-action productions, including \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d and Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cThe Last Duel,\u201d due to the coronavirus. It has delayed the releases of several upcoming films, including \u201cMulan.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">IMF STAFFERS SENT HOME: The International Monetary Fund said Friday that a staff member had tested positive for the coronavirus. As a result, all staffers at the IMF\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters have been advised to work from home until further notice. The 189-nation lending institution said that the staffer who has been diagnosed was self-isolating and receiving medical care. The IMF said all of its staff missions to European countries with a large number of coronavirus cases had been suspended and only essential travel will be allowed to other countries. Even with headquarters staff working from home, the IMF said the agency remained fully operational in terms of helping its member countries.</p>"]}
