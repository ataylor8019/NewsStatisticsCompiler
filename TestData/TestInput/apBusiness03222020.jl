All are untrue. Such falsehoods can endanger public health, sow confusion and fear, and prevent important information from reaching people during a crisis.

It\u2019s why rumors spread and why misinformation travels on social media. It\u2019s also why the chain text message warning of a nationwide lockdown worked so well: Everyone heard it from a friend of a friend who \u201cknows someone.\u201d Be wary of important-sounding information that is not coming from a clear, authoritative source, such as local government agencies and health departments, or national and international public health institutes such as the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a><!-- --> and the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">World Health Organization</a><!-- -->. Posts may also claim that a politician said or did something. You can check that information through legitimate news outlets or the candidates\u2019 own verified social media accounts.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">CDC AND THE WHO</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The top public health institutes in the United States and other countries, along with the WHO, are some of the most trusted sources of information about the outbreak. They provide the latest statistics, advisories and guides on everything from sanitizing your home to managing stress.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dr. Jessica Justman, an infectious disease expert at Columbia University, said the sheer amount of information online about the coronavirus pandemic can quickly become overwhelming. That\u2019s one reason she encourages people to check the websites of the CDC and the WHO.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s not just misinformation, it\u2019s also a lack of good information,\u201d Justman said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much information out there that many people are just saying \u2018I can\u2019t read it, it makes me too anxious.\u2019\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cGo straight to the source,\u201d she said. \u201cThe CDC has been putting out great information.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the same time, be mindful of scammers taking advantage of the CDC\u2019s and other organizations\u2019 trusted names. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">ACT LIKE A JOURNALIST</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cEveryone right now is trying to figure out: What is going on?

Remember that there\u2019s a difference between news stories and opinion pieces. News stories should include the source of the information. If there\u2019s no source or attribution, be suspicious.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In addition to seeking authoritative sources, journalists also seek to confirm information from multiple sources. Even if a news outlet is at first alone in reporting a big development, others will soon follow. If this doesn\u2019t happen, it could be a red flag.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">PAUSE, TAKE A BREATH</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">2018 study</a><!-- --> by MIT researchers found that false news travels faster than real news \u2014 often much faster. That\u2019s because it\u2019s often designed to grab people\u2019s attention by connecting with their emotions, such as fear or outrage. The researchers, who studied how false news travels on Twitter, also found that misinformation spreads quickly because people retweet it, not due to bot activity. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the moment and retweet a terrifying headline before reading the accompanying article. But pausing before reposting can save you from embarrassment and prevent falsehoods from spreading farther.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">DON\u2019T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Bad actors and trolls looking to exploit people\u2019s fears around coronavirus are using a variety of techniques to sow confusion. False news articles are just a small part of this. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Photos and videos can be edited and altered, and real images can be presented out of context. Again, it helps to look for the source. Google\u2019s reverse image search can help find the origins of a photo. For videos, take a look at who uploaded it \u2014 was it a random user? A news outlet? The CDC? </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Americans have a duty not to add to an already anxious time by spreading misinformation that could alarm others \u2014 or put them at risk, said Dr. Ruth Parker, a physician at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta and an expert on health literacy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s a scary time,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to add fuel to the fire.

All while the global pandemic and its <a class=\"\" href=\"/b64cf00f37d8da2fad3533aa7686c53d\">nationwide shutdown</a><!-- --> grip an anxious, isolated population bracing for a healthcare crisis and looming recession. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">When one reporter asked Trump what he would tell a worried nation, the president snapped, \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Despite the enormous pressure on Washington to swiftly act, the challenges are apparent. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers and administration officials labored late into the evening over eye-popping sums and striking federal interventions, surpassing even the 2008-09 bank bailout and stimulus. They\u2019ll be back at it Saturday morning. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cEverybody is working very hard,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, exiting one closed-door session and heading into another. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While key negotiators said they made progress during the daylong talks, they failed to hit an end-of-day deadline to strike a deal. Talks broke around 10:30 p.m.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Mnuchin launched negotiations with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and senators from both parties using McConnell\u2019s GOP offer as a starting point.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cOur nation needs a major next step, and we need it fast,\u201d McConnell said earlier in the day to an empty chamber, the iconic U.S. Capitol closed to visitors. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Preliminary Senate votes are set for Sunday. McConnell said the goal is passage by Monday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Mnuchin also conferred privately Friday with Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the two leaders pressed for Democratic priorities. Pelosi late Friday called the GOP plan a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At one point, Schumer told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re making good progress.\u201d But Schumer acknowledged trying to wrap up \u201ctonight is hard.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The GOP plan aims to pump billions into $1,200 direct checks to Americans and billions to small businesses to pay idled workers during the global pandemic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Democrats say McConnell\u2019s plan is insufficient, arguing for greater income support for workers and a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for the U.S. healthcare industry, which is preparing for an onslaught of newly sick patients. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the White House, Trump welcomed the stimulus plan, believing it is needed to stabilize the economy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Trump spent much of Friday\u2019s daily briefing in a fury, an angry president lashing out at reporters\u2019 questions. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At times, he seemed to refuse to want to hear the reality of an increasingly dire situation. It was when one reporter noted the hard facts in the U.S. \u2014 that more than 200 are dead, more than 14,000 infected and millions scared \u2014 that he snapped back.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump also sowed further confusion about whether he is using the powers of the Defense Production Act to force American businesses to manufacture needed medical supplies.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Friday phone calls with Trump, Schumer said he specifically implored the president to invoke the Korean War-era act to ramp up production of desperately needed ventilators and other gear. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump told the Democratic leader he would do it \u2014 and then Schumer said the president could be heard yelling to someone in his office \u201cget it done.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Trump told reporters he had put the order he invoked Wednesday \u201cinto gear\u201d Thursday night. He said he had directed companies to launch production. But then he walked it back, saying, \u201cYou know, so far, we haven\u2019t had to\u201d because companies are volunteering.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The administration also announced a further closing of the nation\u2019s border, as the U.S. and Mexico agreed to limit crossings to all but essential travel and trade, while the U.S. moved to restrict entry to anyone without documentation.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Later Friday, the White House said a member of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s staff had tested positive for the new coronavirus. Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller said the staff member, who is not being identified, did not have \u201cclose contact\u201d either the vice president or Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Unveiled Thursday, McConnell\u2019s rescue proposal from Republicans builds on Trump\u2019s request for Congress to \u201cgo big.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The GOP plan proposes $300 billion for small businesses to keep idled workers on payroll and $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries. It also seeks to relax a just-enacted family and medical leave mandate on small to medium-sized businesses from an earlier rescue package.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It puts McConnell\u2019s imprint on the GOP approach after the Senate leader left earlier negotiations to Pelosi and Mnuchin, which angered some of his GOP senators feeling cut out of the final product. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Keeping paychecks flowing for workers not at work is a top priority for both Democrats and Republicans as <a class=\"\" href=\"/d2a5e80b7ba7d568e9e6a3966d6308d0\">jobless claims skyrocket.</a></p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But how best to send direct payments to Americans \u2014 as one-time stipends, ongoing payroll support or unemployment checks \u2014 is a crucial debate.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Under McConnell\u2019s approach, small businesses with 500 or fewer employees would be able to tap up to $10 million in forgivable loans from the federal government to continue cutting paychecks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Democrats prefer sending the money to workers via the existing unemployment insurance system. Schumer called it \u201cunemployment insurance on steroids.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Both income support approaches have benefits and drawbacks, lawmakers said. Republicans say their plan would keep workers linked to employers, for easy recall once the crisis abates. Democrats argue the unemployment system provides a ready-made distribution channel, though states could also become overwhelmed by the surge of jobless claims. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Meanwhile, industries of all kinds are lining up for help. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As the Senate chairmen hammered out the details \u2014 and House chairmen funneled their input \u2014 the total price tag is sure to grow beyond $1 trillion, lawmakers said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The House, which adjourned last weekend, is not expected to resume until the new package is ready.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Lawmakers on conference calls with leaders this week said they preferred not to board airplanes amid the virus outbreak. Despite calls to change the rules, Congress does not have a mechanism in place for remote voting. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump has already signed into law a $100 billion-plus bill to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers hit by it. Earlier, Trump signed an initial $8.3 billion package from Congress.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

(AP) \u2014 Pennsylvania\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose by one on Saturday as lawyers for Gov. Tom Wolf asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging his authority to shutter \u201cnon-life-sustaining\u201d businesses, declaring that unprecedented action is needed to combat a global pandemic they called \u201cperhaps the biggest catastrophe of our lifetimes.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Allegheny County Health Department confirmed the death Saturday and described the person as an adult in the late 60s who had been hospitalized.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">More than 370 coronavirus cases and two deaths have been reported in Pennsylvania. Health Secretary Rachel Levine said the state is seeing a spike in cases because more people are getting infected, not because testing has expanded. She also revealed Saturday that Wolf\u2019s administration is considering a \u201cshelter in place\u201d order to ensure people stay at home.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wolf has already discouraged people from going out, if they can avoid it, and ordered schools shut through March, at least.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a legal filing late Friday, the state attorney general\u2019s office said Wolf is empowered by the state\u2019s Emergency Management Services Code to shutter businesses and to restrict people\u2019s movements in a disaster.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cCOVID-19 presents an extraordinary challenge that requires extraordinary measures to combat. The governor was empowered by law to combat precisely this challenge,\u201d the filing said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The state Supreme Court did not immediately rule on a lawsuit challenging Wolf\u2019s authority to shut down gun shops and other companies. A second lawsuit, filed by a Harrisburg-area law firm, was withdrawn Saturday, one day after the Wolf administration relaxed its blanket closure of law offices.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wolf has justified his edict that tens of thousands of businesses shutter their doors indefinitely by citing big, daily upticks in the number of COVID-19 cases that health officials say threaten to overwhelm hospitals and spike the death toll. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Under pressure from Republicans and business owners, Wolf agreed to delay enforcement of the shutdown order until Monday. His administration also agreed to exempt additional businesses from the shutdown, including the timber industry, coal mines, hotels, accountants and laundromats.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A gun shop claimed in a lawsuit that Wolf\u2019s edict violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms and other constitutional rights.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wolf\u2019s lawyers said that nothing in his order prevents a citizen from owning a gun.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cPetitioners\u2019 argument that the global COVID-19 pandemic is somehow not a disaster demonstrates a dangerous level of myopathy about the effect this pandemic could have on the citizens of the commonwealth and our health care system if the spread of this disease is not arrested,\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office wrote.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wolf\u2019s administration has steadfastly refused to confirm to The Associated Press whether gun shops are covered by his shutdown order. Its legal filing said the governor\u2019s office used industry codes generated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to construct its list of businesses covered by the shutdown order.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAny business would already know which sector it occupies and its corresponding NAICS code,\u201d the filing said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Saturday, Joshua Prince, a lawyer challenging the governor\u2019s edict, called the legal filing \u201cmerely another smoke and mirrors response by the commonwealth, as it is acutely aware that there is no NAICS code relative to the sale, manufacture or transfer of firearms and ammunition.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He said the coding issue arises frequently for federal firearms licensees when they attempt to procure financing, \u201cas there is no applicable code.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wolf\u2019s legal team also said that voluntary requests for Pennsylvanians to stay away from one another and for businesses to close their doors and have employees work from home proved ineffective at slowing the spread of the disease, requiring more drastic action.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cPennsylvanians refused to voluntarily engage in \u2018social distancing\u2019 to prevent the spread of COVID-19, leaving Governor Wolf with no option other than to close nonessential businesses to \u2018lessen the curve\u2019 of the disease,\u201d the filing said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u2014-</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">CASES</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Allegheny County\u2019s death brought to two the deaths reported in the state.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">State health officials on Saturday reported more than 100 new cases in Pennsylvania, for a total of more than 370, with about 40 people requiring hospitalization. Philadelphia Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the city had confirmed its first positive case in a nursing home resident.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Levine said people with mild symptoms do not necessarily need to get tested, and, after calling their doctor, they may be able to stay home, rest, take fluids and anti-fever medication.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Testing is being prioritized for symptomatic people who are health care providers, elderly, have chronic medical conditions or are very ill, Levine said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

You can still see a doctor if you can\u2019t leave home during the coronavirus outbreak. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">U.S. public health officials, hospitals and insurance companies are pushing people to try telemedicine for their allergies, earaches and other minor problems and skip the doctor\u2019s office or clinic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It\u2019s also a way to check in with a doctor if you think you have symptoms of COVID-19.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The goal: Prevent the spread of coronavirus, especially to those who are most vulnerable, older people and those with existing health conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Virtual care has long been touted as a way to get help quickly instead of waiting days to see a doctor, yet Americans have been slow to embrace it. There are signs that may be changing because of COVID-19.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Here\u2019s a closer look at how telemedicine works.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WHAT IS TELEMEDICINE?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Got a smartphone, tablet or computer? That\u2019s all you really need to use telemedicine, sometimes called telehealth or virtual visits. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Generally, it just refers to a video visit with a remotely located care provider like a doctor or therapist over a secure connection. The patient uses a website link or an app to connect.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some telemedicine outlets also offer a version using text messages between a doctor and patient who may not actually speak to or see each other. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Telemedicine often involves diagnosing and treating a new health problem but is also used to keep tabs on an existing, long-term conditions like diabetes. It\u2019s more than calling to get a prescription refill, although doctors can write some prescriptions, like antibiotics, after a telemedicine visit.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WHO OFFERS IT?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Insurers and hospital systems are frequent sources. In fact, your email inbox may have an offer from one of those providers urging you to try it now because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The federal government last week said it will immediately expand telemedicine access to help people with Medicare, its coverage program for those 65 and over as well as younger patients who qualify because of a disability. And it urged states to expand the service to those enrolled in Medicaid, the government coverage program for people with low incomes.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Medicare coverage of telemedicine had been limited, largely to rural areas where patients had to go to specially-designated sites for their visits. Many Medicare Advantage plans run by insurers also provide access to telemedicine.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WHAT DOES IT COST?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Prices vary. But many insurance companies and other providers are temporarily waiving fees to push more people to use some virtual care. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Check before your visit with the insurer or employer that provides your coverage. The plan may not cover some specialty care like virtual therapy sessions or it may offer limited coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">What if you don\u2019t have insurance? You can pay out-of-pocket through some telemedicine providers. MDLive treats mostly through video chats and charges $75 for an urgent care visit. A session with a dermatologist costs $69.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Another company, 98point6, charges a $20 annual fee and then $1 for each visit. The company diagnoses and treats through secure text messaging. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WHAT IS TELEMEDICINE FOR?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Sinus infections, bronchitis, the flu, asthma, pink eye or fevers are just a few examples. Telemedicine can handle a lot of care that would normally send patients to a doctor\u2019s office or drugstore clinic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dermatologists can examine warts or moles remotely. Therapists also can treat anxiety, depression or stress while allowing patients to remain in a place like their home where they feel more comfortable.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Patients worried about the coronavirus also can get a quick cyber consultation with a doctor. Many telemedicine providers have designed computer programs to ask patients initial questions to help gauge their health or their risk of virus exposure.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WHAT ARE ITS LIMITS?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A virtual physician cannot treat chest pains, broken bones or cuts that need stitches. That doctor also won\u2019t be able to perform a coronavirus test. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In some cases, they also may have to refer patients to another doctor for an in-person visit. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Telemedicine providers often tout their ability to connect patients with help in a matter of minutes. But a surge in coronavirus-fueled demand has slowed response times for some providers.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Doctors also say there are some parts of an in-person visit that telemedicine cannot replicate. A doctor may spot additional health problems simply by noticing a change in a regular patient\u2019s behavior or appearance.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cMy examination starts when I see the patient walk in the room, the way they talk, the way they walk, just subtle things,\u201d said Dr. Gary LeRoy, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. \u201cIt can\u2019t always be done remotely.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WHY CAN PATIENTS BE SLOW TO TRY IT?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Researchers have long said that health care behavior is hard to change. In telemedicine\u2019s case, patients may be especially reluctant to try something unfamiliar, especially if it doesn\u2019t involve their regular doctor.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Awareness is another problem. People may hear about telemedicine from their employer or insurer and then forget about it when they need help a few months later.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But people frequently become repeat customers after trying telemedicine, said Dr. Jason Tibbels, an executive with telemedicine provider Teladoc Health. And he thinks that the awareness created by the coronavirus will last long after the pandemic fades. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThese are the moments that we were built for,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Follow Tom Murphy on Twitter: @thpmurphy</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives <a href=\"https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2018/ap-hhmi-expand-collaboration-to-bolster-health-science-coverage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">support</a><!-- --> from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

SISAK", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state is scouring the globe for medical supplies and scouting temporary hospital locations as the coronavirus crisis grows. Flights to New York City-area airports were briefly suspended after an air-traffic control worker tested positive. As the number of confirmed cases statewide soared above 12,000, Columbia University\u2019s chief of surgery raised alarms about a torrent of patients soon overwhelming emergency rooms. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">More on the latest coronavirus developments Saturday in New York:</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">HOSPITAL BEDS &amp; SUPPLIES</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Cuomo said the goal is to quickly boost the state\u2019s hospital capacity from around 50,000 beds to 75,000 beds. About 1,600 people have been hospitalized so far. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Federal Emergency Management Agency has declared a major disaster in the state, freeing up access to billions of dollars in relief funding. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As of late Saturday night, the disease has killed at least 76 people in New York state, according to a tracking effort at Johns Hopkins University. At least 60 of those deaths were in New York City.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Cuomo said the state is looking to see if the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan could be suitable for 1,000 requested field hospital beds that would be supplied by FEMA in a \u201ctent configuration\u201d with equipment and staff.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Also Saturday, the state was scouting four locations for temporary hospitals that would be built by the Army Corps of Engineers, Cuomo said. The possible sites include the Javits Center, Stony Brook University and SUNY Old Westbury on Long Island, and the Westchester County Center north of the city.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cEverything that can be done is being done,\u201d Cuomo said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Officials have identified 2 million masks that can be sent to hot spots, and apparel companies are pivoting to make masks, Cuomo said. A million masks were being sent Saturday to New York City hospitals, and 500,000 to Long Island.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Because of dwindling supplies, hospitals have been rationing supplies and asking staff to reuse masks until they become soiled. Columbia University\u2019s chief surgeon, Dr. Craig Smith, said hospitals in the New York-Presbyterian system are burning through about 40,000 masks a day \u2014 about 10 times the normal amount.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The state is also rounding up critically needed ventilators, purchasing 6,000 to deploy to the most critical areas and investigating whether multiple patients can be served by a single ventilator, Cuomo said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe are literally scouring the globe looking for medical supplies,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The state also will immediately start conducting trials of an experimental COVID-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax, Cuomo said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, has been touted by President Donald Trump as a possible answer-in-waiting to the outbreak, though many experts caution more testing needs to be done. Cuomo said the Food and Drug Administration is sending 10,000 doses to the state.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">____</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u2018A HORROR TO IMAGINE\u2019</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Smith has been raising alarms about the rapid surge of patients and dwindling supplies in daily letters to colleagues that are being posted to the Columbia surgery department\u2019s Twitter account.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Smith warned that new projections estimate the number of coronavirus patients will continue to grow over the next 22 to 32 days, overwhelming the New York-Presbyterian system\u2019s emergency rooms and intensive care units, even with measures taken to build new capacity. The projections show the system\u2019s hospitals needing 700 to 934 ICU beds when the outbreak reaches its peak.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Just Friday, he wrote, the system saw a 50% increase in coronavirus patients, making for a total of 300 being treated and another 200 awaiting test results.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cNothing would give me greater pleasure than to apologize profusely in a few weeks for having overestimated the threat,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cThat would mean we never exceeded capacity, and that mortalities and morbidities rarely seen in non-pandemic circumstances were avoided. The next month or two is a horror to imagine if we\u2019re underestimating the threat.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At NYU Langone Health, another hospital operator, the \u201cERs are extremely busy\u201d and some patients are being treated in space retrofitted to expand capacity, spokesman Jim Mandler said Saturday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">FLIGHT DISRUPTIONS</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Federal Aviation Administration briefly suspended flights to New York City-area airports on Saturday after a trainee at a regional air-traffic control hub on Long Island tested positive for the disease.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In an alert posted online, the FAA advised air traffic controllers to \u201cstop all departures\u201d to John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, Newark and other airports in the region because of staffing issues at the Ronkonkoma facility, which the agency says primarily handles high-altitude, cross-country flights.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The halt, which also affected Philadelphia\u2019s airport, was lifted after about 30 minutes. Controllers were initially warned it could last several hours. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a statement, the FAA said the Ronkonkoma facility remains open. The agency said the trainee was last there on Tuesday and that is it working to figure out what other workers he may have interacted with. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Air traffic controllers at Kennedy operated from an alternate location on airport property this week after a technician assigned to the airport\u2019s control tower tested positive for COVID-19.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The FAA said that the technician hadn\u2019t been to work since March 11 and that controllers returned to the tower after precautionary cleaning.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">CHANGES TO TOLLS, DMV</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">New York State Thruway toll collectors will stop taking cash Sunday night as a safety measure.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Drivers without an E-ZPass tag should enter the highway through a cash lane without taking a ticket. When they exit, drivers should tell a collector which exit they entered and provide license plate information. A bill will be sent to the owner of the vehicle in about a month.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There are no changes for drivers with E-ZPass.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Also Saturday, Cuomo ordered the suspension of in-office visits at the Department of Motor Vehicles.

But this pandemic, and the steps New York and other places are taking to fight it, like shutdowns and social distancing? It\u2019s like nothing they\u2019ve ever seen.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The coronavirus \u201cseemed like an avalanche, the speed at which things changed,\u201d said David Berson, general manager at Peter Luger, the Brooklyn steakhouse that opened in 1887 and has been operated by his family since 1950.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The state order for restaurants to halt dine-in service and allow for only delivery and takeout has been a huge challenge at Luger, a special-occasion kind of place with high-end prices that dry-ages its own steaks and orders its supply well in advance.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It has meant severely cutting back on restaurant staff, down to a skeleton crew of about half a dozen from a normal contingent of about 100, Berson said. Everyone\u2019s being paid their usual salaries for the time being.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It also means figuring out some inventory concerns, because right now, \u201cwe have a lot of dry-aged meat,\u201d he said. \u201cLiteral tons.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">They\u2019ve found ways to use some of it for a good cause, like bringing lunch for hospital workers.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It\u2019s such a contrast from how Berson remembers the atmosphere after the Sept. 11 attacks, when the ask for people was to go out and support businesses.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Now \u201cthe best thing to do is the opposite, stay home,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The state\u2019s order for restaurants to limit their operations so that people don\u2019t gather in close proximity is a central part of efforts to limit the transmission of the novel coronavirus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. The vast majority of people recover.

The index has declined in four of the last five weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The latest sell-off wiped out the gains from a day earlier and capped the market\u2019s worst week since the financial crisis of 2008.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Investors are worried that the coronavirus will plunge the U.S. and other major economies into deep recessions. Steps to contain the spread of the outbreak are causing massive disruptions and layoffs. Optimism that emergency actions by central banks and governments to ease the economic damage has waned as investors wait for the Trump administration to deliver on legislation that will pump billions of dollars into hurting households and industries.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe coronavirus is shutting the economy down,\u201d said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. At the same time, oil prices are being pulled lower by increased supplies at a time when demand is declining.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis is kind of a double-whammy for the economy,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Friday\u2019s selling accelerated after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that most workers stay home. The declaration came a day after California announced similar measures. The move leaves restaurants, retailers and other businesses dependent on consumer traffic in economic limbo as they\u2019re forced to close doors and furlough or lay off workers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The measures also mean less demand for oil. U.S. crude dropped about 21% and moved below $20 a barrel for first time since February 2002.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Investors say they need to see the number of new infections stop accelerating for the market\u2019s volatile skid to ease.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what the next two weeks will bring,\u201d said Paul Christopher, global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cAre we going to follow the same infection curve as other countries and the number infections will drastically accelerate?

The index is down 31.9% since reaching a record high a month ago.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Investors sought safety in U.S. government bonds, driving their yields broadly lower. The 10-year Treasury yield, which influences interest rates on mortgages and other consumer loans, slid to 0.88% from 1.12% late Thursday. At least that\u2019s normal markets behavior. Earlier in the week investors were selling stocks and bonds at the same time in a desperate rush to raise cash. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Oil has been plunging recent weeks as investors anticipate a sharp drop in demand for energy as manufacturing, travel and commerce grind nearly to a halt. It\u2019s down from $45 a barrel earlier this month. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia has also pushed oil lower. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">European and Asian markets closed broadly higher.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Despite the latest bout of selling, hopes remain that there will be progress in finding virus treatments and that \u201ca boatload of stimulus by both central banks and governments will put the global economy in position for a U-shaped recovery,\u201d said Edward Moya of Oanda in a report.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Capitol Hill, lawmakers continued to work to finalize a $1 trillion-plus aid package to prop up households and the U.S. economy that would put money directly into Americans\u2019 pockets.

That brings it in line with the restriction on the Canadian border earlier this week. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Even with the market\u2019s broad slide, airlines, hotels and cruise line operators climbed as Congress worked on the economic stimulus bill that would include billions to bail out those industries. United Airlines surged 15.1% and MGM Resorts International jumped 18.3%. Carnival rose 20%. Despite the big gains, the stocks are still down sharply for the year.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In just its latest move to backstop the markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve said Friday it would seek to hold down spiking interest rates in the state and municipal bond market by supporting banks\u2019 purchase of the bonds.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Investors are jumpy due to uncertainty about the size and duration of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and the spreading wave of business shutdowns meant to help contain it.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Markets are likely in for more turblence next week as investors get a better look at the economic fallout from businesses closures and layoffs.

Some 93,000 people have recovered, mostly in China.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Spain, Europe\u2019s hardest-hit country behind Italy, intensive care units in some areas were close to their limits even before Sunday\u2019s new tally of 28,572 infections and 1,720 deaths. The army was building a field hospital with 5,500 beds in a convention center in Madrid, where hotels are also being turned into wards for virus patients without serious breathing problems.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the U.S., New Jersey and St. Louis were added to a growing list of areas where residents were ordered to stay home. Hawaii\u2019s governor instituted a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine starting Thursday for both returning residents and visitors and urged people to delay planned vacations to the Pacific archipelago. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Milan, the capital of Italy\u2019s prosperous Lombardy region, appeared more deserted than ever. The square in front of the Duomo was empty except for one older couple walking a dog.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Lombardy has raised the fines for people out without a good reason from 207 euros ($222) to 5,000 euros ($5,380). Officials lamented last week that the number of people on the streets was still too high to break the pandemic. The number of buses, trams and metros were cut \u2014 but that only caused more Italians to go out in their cars and was revoked.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The first of nine hulking Russian Il-76 cargo planes left Chkalovsky military airport in Moscow on Sunday, bringing Russian medical personnel and supplies to Italy, including eight mobile medical teams.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Chinese city of Wuhan \u2014 where the global pandemic was first detected and the first city to be locked down \u2014 went a fourth consecutive day on Sunday without reporting any new or suspected cases. Wuhan must go 14 straight days without a new case in order for draconian travel restrictions to be lifted, but a special train brought in more than 1,000 car factory employees for the first time since the outbreak.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Parks and other public gathering places are reopening in China as people return to work and businesses resume. However, the country has placed increasing restrictions on those coming from overseas.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">All arrivals to Beijing from abroad must be quarantine themselves for two weeks in a hotel at their own expense. And beginning Monday, flights into the capital will be diverted to airports in other cities, where passengers will have to pass a health inspection.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">China\u2019s first recent case of community infection was reported Sunday in the southern province of Guangzhou eportedly caught from a Turkish arrival. As the outbreak has died down domestically, an influx of people coming into China has stoked fears of a resurgence.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Borders kept closing and airlines kept slashing flights. The long-haul carrier Emirates, a crucial East-West link that has now cut 70% of its routes, had been flying into Beijing despite the virus outbreak. Its Beijing flights, however, will end Monday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">After recording its first two deaths, Singapore said it will fully shut its borders beginning Tuesday. All short-term visitors will be barred while returning locals will face a 14-day quarantine.

Fishermen are returning home to California to find a state all but shuttered and nowhere to sell their catch. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A handful of tuna boats filled with tens of thousands of pounds of fish are now floating off San Diego\u2019s coast as they scramble to find customers. Many wholesalers stopped buying as restaurants were ordered closed except for takeout.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">San Diego, once known as the tuna capital of the world, boasts a thriving industry that sells primarily to wholesale buyers and restaurants.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Many are third-generation fishermen, like Nick Haworth. He pulled up his vessel to a dock in downtown San Diego with 30,000 pounds (13,600 kilograms) of big eye tuna and opah. It was selling for $10 a pound to the public, a third of the market price. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Another two vessels planned to sell at the dock Saturday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis is a quarantine special,\u201d a tanned Haworth donning a mask and blue surgical gloves joked as he took orders from people standing 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart on the dock while seals barked around his boat, the Kaylee H.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">When Haworth left a month ago to fish about 600 miles (970 kilometers) from the coast, the coronavirus was still concentrated primarily in China. The general feeling, he said, was that it was coming under control. President Donald Trump was telling the nation the numbers were only going to get better. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As his crew motored farther out to sea, a pandemic was declared, though Haworth didn\u2019t know it because his radio was broken. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It wasn\u2019t until they were returning weeks later and were within 50 miles (80 kilometers), or about five hours away, that they picked up a signal for their TV to work and learned from the news of the worldwide closures, including in California and the Philippines, where many of his crew members have family. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">California on Friday confined its 40 million residents to home in the strictest response yet.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe second we saw the news, I knew we were screwed,\u201d Haworth said as he drove a boat filled with thousands of pounds of fish toward home. \u201cWe were all like, \u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The wholesale buyers who agreed to buy the fish reneged, he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Haworth was grateful people were lining up \u2014 keeping a safe distance apart, of course. The fishermen were also offering home deliveries. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For the past few years, boats have been allowed to sell from the downtown dock on Saturdays as part of a large farmer\u2019s market. Haworth hopes the city will allow the dockside market to stay open regularly during the lockdown. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Local fish advocate Tommy Gomes, known as Tommy the Fishmonger, was helping with the impromptu fish market at the city\u2019s G street dock, allowing only about a dozen people on the dock at a time. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWholesalers are stuck with all this fish and they\u2019re not taking more, so fishermen are in a tight spot,\u201d he said. \u201cThis stuff doesn\u2019t get better with age, like beef.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Jim Silveira, also a third-generation fisherman and owner of Chula Seafood, said one fishermen already had to dump $80,000 worth of squid overboard. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He fears boats will stop going out, crews will be laid off, and when the governor\u2019s shelter-in-place order is lifted, it\u2019ll take months to get the supply back. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Silveira was helping a vessel that pulled up to his dockside fish shop in Chula Vista, south of San Diego, with 35,000 pounds (15,875 kilograms) of tuna. They decided to package most of what would normally be sold locally and fly it to other states like Florida and Texas. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wholesaler Dave Rudie of Catalina Offshore bought from another boat with 30,000 pounds (13,600 kilograms), though his restaurant sales have plummeted. He\u2019s offering it to the public for $7.99 a pound at his warehouse.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI made a commitment to the boat, so I bought the fish and am doing the best I can to still pay fishermen, but it is a challenge, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are strange and unusual times. But I do see some future: We all have to eat.\u201d</p>"]}
{"title": "Trump\u2019s fate tied to an unknown: how fast economy recovers", "articleDate": "March 22, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By JOSH BOAK", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 The <a class=\"\" href=\"/VirusOutbreak\">coronavirus</a><!-- --> has flung the U.S. economy into a dangerous tailspin, and President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection hopes are caught in the sudden whirlwind.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For the next seven months, Trump may be consigned to campaigning in a country beset by a fear of job loss, bankruptcy and disease. It will require a remarkable pivot for the president, who has relentlessly cheered the stock market\u2019s rise and the economy\u2019s strength as the central predicate for a second term. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Many economists say the expected federal stimulus will not prevent a recession. Officials put the price tag of the <a class=\"\" href=\"/9aeebd670bd0bc320ae6cebd1c17ddf3\">developing package</a><!-- --> on Capitol Hill at nearly $1.4 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve, the financial rescue could pump $2 trillion into the U.S. economy. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Stocks have already collapsed. Businesses and schools are closing to try to contain the outbreak. Requests for unemployment benefits suggest that weekly layoffs could soon eclipse the worst of the Great Recession as millions of people lose their jobs. Analysts at the bank Goldman Sachs estimate that 2.25 million Americans filed for jobless aid over the past week, a total slightly higher than the job gains for all of 2019.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cNothing can stop an economic downturn now,\u201d said Aaron Sojourner, a University of Minnesota professor and former White House economist. He said that the major questions confronting lawmakers are how the country can weather a recession, when the widespread quarantines can end and how enough jobs can be preserved to stir a recovery. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The economy and politics have collided in a such a profound way that no one knows how the election will play out in November. Trump\u2019s fate may rest on just how long the downturn lasts and whether Americans judge it to be an outside shock caused by nature or the result of government negligence or incompetence.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe situation is not good -- that is different from saying the president is responsible for it,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist. \u201cIt is much easier to explain away a deep recession as an act of God.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Yet voters might not feel all that forgiving. The administration has repeatedly played down the coronavirus\u2019 health and economic risks. Only a month ago, the top White House economist suggested at a meeting with reporters that an outbreak would do little to harm growth.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI don\u2019t think corona is as big a threat as people make it out to be,\u201d said Tomas Philipson, acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, at the time. \u201cWhat I can say is that if you look at the resilience of an economy to a public health threat, certainly we have much bigger threats than the coronavirus.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The lethality of the virus has now overridden such optimism. California and New York are among the states on near lockdown status, and many others are in essentially the same place. Trump himself has abruptly changed his tone, and top federal health officials are now trying to prepare Americans for the soaring number of cases they believe are sure to come.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump has relied on his trademark salesmanship, consistently talking about how fast the economy will spring back once the virus wanes, repeatedly speaking in superlatives from the White House briefing room about how pent up demand will generate a positive surge. His words will be measured carefully by voters in little over seven months, when the fallout from the pandemic probably will be clearer. But many economists do not believe the recovery will automatically start like the flip of a switch.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president anticipates that any downturn \u2014 which analysts say could exceed an annualized rate of 10% over the next quarter \u2014 would be followed by a snapback to growth. The result is that the line charting U.S. gross domestic product would form a \u201cv\u201d shape. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI believe in the V-curve,\u201d the president said Thursday. \u201cWhen this is defeated, this hidden scourge is defeated, I think we\u2019re going to go up very rapidly, our economy, and get back to where it was and beyond.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That same optimism about a fast recovery followed the housing bust more than a decade ago. Instead, there was a gradual expansion that disappointed many voters and helped usher Trump into the presidency in 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There is a risk this time that the United States could be trapped in a \u201crecession doom loop,\u201d said Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University professor and the top economist in George W. Bush\u2019s White House when the 9/11 terrorist attacks provoked similar concerns about a slowdown.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hubbard said many of the proposed stimulus ideas would not help restore growth once the virus subsides. Consumers would benefit from checks that could come to $1,200 per individual. But loans and tax breaks would not replace the lost revenues of many small businesses and manufacturers. This means those companies might stay permanently closed and the recovery would be sabotaged. Half of small businesses surveyed this past week by Goldman Sachs said they can only afford to operate for three months or less. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThat\u2019s the doom loop that I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fixable, but it requires more attention than what we\u2019re getting in Washington. This is about making sure the economy can restart.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump\u2019s political survival may well depend on whether that happens.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Yale University economist Ray Fair has developed a model for how the economy impacts elections. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Depending on inflation, Fair\u2019s model shows the majority of votes would go to the Democratic nominee, likely former Vice President Joe Biden, if the economy shrinks over three quarters at an annual rate of roughly 4.4% per person. A decline that steep has occurred seven times since 1952, but never during a presidential election year.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Robert Stein, an economist at First Trust Advisors and a former Treasury Department official, said an election in such a turbulent economy is uncharted territory.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He expects the economy to shrink at an annualized rate of 15% in March and April, hold steady in May and begin to recover in June.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf you look at traditional models relating economic growth and election results, what\u2019s happening now is not good for President Trump,\u201d Stein said. \u201cBut if the downturn is disease or illness-related, my gut \u2014 and I\u2019m not saying this as an economist \u2014 is the electorate will give you a little more of a pass. But I don\u2019t know. The sample size is zero.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

And even in the current pandemic, any payout to stricken countries would barely make a dent into what the outbreak has cost them.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Former World Bank chief economist Lawrence Summers has described the bonds as \u201cfinancial goofiness.\u201d The bonds were launched in the aftermath of the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and the current coronavirus outbreak is exposing flaws in their design.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe countries that need help are not the ones getting the funds,\u201d said Felix Stein of the University of Cambridge, who has researched the bonds. \u201cIt\u2019s the Wall Street investors that are benefiting.\u2033</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The bonds are a form of disaster insurance and work essentially like this: the World Bank sells bonds to private sector investors, who get a yearly return, partly paid for by donor countries. If an epidemic occurs, the investors lose the capital they initially used to buy the bonds. That money is sent as aid to countries affected by the epidemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The problem, experts say, is that investors like Baillie Gifford and Amundi and Oppenheimer were getting high returns - as much as 11% a year.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">And the bonds required a certain number of people to die before countries receive any payout, among other conditions, complicating any immediate efforts to snuff out the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Upon their launch, the bonds were described by the World Bank as a way \u201cto help prevent a high-severity infectious disease outbreak from becoming a pandemic\u201d by making essential financing available to key responders.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">According to the bonds\u2019 criteria, 12 weeks must pass before a payout for a coronavirus epidemic can be made. The outbreak must also be sustained, have affected at least two countries, and have caused at least 250 deaths.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The World Bank said that date would be met on March 23 and that a decision for a payout would then be made by an independent agency. The bank said the maximum potential payout was about $196 million. Only the world\u2019s poorest countries are eligible for funds, making any immediate pay-out unlikely, as the hardest-hit countries include China, Italy, Iran, Spain and South Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Taxpayers in Australia, Germany and Japan and the International Development Association, meanwhile, have put up about $176 million so far to back the bonds.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a 2019 paper published in the BMJ, Clare Wenham of the London School of Economics and a colleague found that as of last year, the pandemic bonds had paid nearly $115 million to investors while providing only $61 million via a \u201ccash window\u201d mechanism to Congo, for its most recent Ebola epidemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wenham said the payout conditions are too arbitrary and long. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cBy the time the required number of people die in a certain number of countries, the pandemic is clearly going to have spread quite significantly,\u201d she said, describing the mechanism as \u201cflawed\u201d and overcomplicated. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">To date, the new coronavirus has infected more than 307,000 people and killed over 13,000. The illness has been deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization, meaning it will likely reach every country in the world. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Some 92,000 have already recovered from the virus, mostly in China.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wenham said the bonds might work better if the payout was linked to another trigger, like when the WHO declares a global health emergency like it did in late January.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf the whole idea is to help prevent a pandemic, it doesn\u2019t make sense to wait until the pandemic is spreading before paying out,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Olga Jonas, an economist at Harvard University who previously worked at the World Bank, says it\u2019s unclear why the pandemic bonds are even necessary.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe World Bank has ample financial capacity to finance responses to outbreaks because it has $29 billion of liquid assets,\u201d she said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Earlier this month, the World Bank announced it would make $14 billion available to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The bank declined to say if the pandemic bonds would be continued in another form after COVID-19. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\"> ___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Policies that do \u2014 called \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d \u2014 cost significantly more and may only cover 50-75% of a traveler\u2019s losses.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cUnfortunately, what consumers end up getting often is less than they expect,\u201d said Octavio Blanco, who has researched travel insurance for Consumer Reports magazine.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Blanco says travel insurance is a good idea if you\u2019re traveling to a place where you feel more at risk of getting sick or if you have a medical condition that could force you to cancel your trip.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But he doesn\u2019t recommend buying it simply because you think you might want to call the trip off. Policies generally have a very specific list of covered reasons for cancellation \u2014 losing a job or a terrorist incident within 30 days of the date of travel, for example \u2014 but general concern about traveling isn\u2019t one of them.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Travelers should expect a travel insurance policy to cost between 4% and 10% of the total cost of their trip. But plans vary widely. Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection offers a policy starting at $26 that covers lost luggage and flight delays. A pricier plan for adventurous travels will pay up to $750,000 for a medical evacuation.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A plan that lets you cancel for any reason costs 40-60% more than a standard plan, says Meghan Walch, product manager for InsureMyTrip.com, a website that lets shoppers compare travel insurance. Consumers have to decide if they want to pay $700 or so for \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d insurance on a $1,000 flight or just eat the cost of the flight if they decide to cancel the trip.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Walch said the industry has seen a spike in sales of \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d policies since the new coronavirus hit. Travel insurance sales generally have tripled since January, she said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Last May, when American Airlines had a fare sale, Chandler O\u2019Brien bought a roundtrip ticket to Tokyo for $650. Her 10-day trip to Japan is scheduled to begin April 1. O\u2019Brien, who does sales and design for an event rental company in Austin, Texas, said she doesn\u2019t usually buy travel insurance. But since the ticket was purchased so far ahead of her travel, she added $60 for travel insurance through Allianz Global Assistance, which American offered on its web site.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">O\u2019Brien recently decided to cancel the trip because of concerns about the outbreak. American Airlines waived its $250 cancellation fee and offered her a credit on future travel. The catch? Her future travel must be completed by May since that will mark a year since she bought the ticket. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">O\u2019Brien thinks it will still be too soon to travel to Japan, and she\u2019s frustrated that American won\u2019t refund her money. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201c\u2019All of the Japanese hotels and restaurants I had booked very nicely cancelled and gave me a full refund with no hesitation,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">O\u2019Brien plans to file a claim with Allianz, but isn\u2019t sure how much the policy will cover.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Here are some recommendations if you\u2019re considering travel insurance:</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">SHOP AROUND: Resist the temptation to add on the insurance offered when you\u2019re booking a flight or a cruise. Instead, shop around for the best deal and the coverage you need on sites like InsureMyTrip.com and Squaremouth.com. Walch says you should typically buy travel insurance 10 to 21 days after you buy tickets for your trip.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">CHECK YOUR WALLET: Some credit cards or health insurance plans may already cover you while you\u2019re traveling. Certain American Express cards come with automatic basic travel insurance, for example, which may cover flight cancellations, rental car damage, lost baggage or flight delays. Some health plans will cover international care at an out-of-network rate, but if you have a pre-existing condition, you may have to purchase a waiver to make sure you are covered overseas, Consumer Reports says.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">READ THE FINE PRINT: Before you buy, make sure the travel insurance you\u2019re considering covers everything you think it should. Insurance paperwork can be a long, dull read, but it\u2019s worth the effort. If you\u2019re unsure, call the company.</p>"]}

Up to $82 billion Canadian (US$56.4 billion) is being spent. The money is about 3% of Canada\u2019s gross domestic product.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Trudeau said he will provide employers of small businesses with a temporary wage subsidy equal to 10% of the salary paid to employees for a period of three months.

But he did not give examples as to how he was using it.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At a news conference Saturday, Trump singled out GM and Ford as among the many businesses that have asked to start making medical gear like ventilators, the need for which he said has grown into the hundreds of thousands. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cNobody\u2019s ever heard of a thing like that.

And auto plants generally aren\u2019t clean enough to make medical equipment. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Companies also would have to find mask or ventilator manufacturers willing to share knowledge, expertise and even factory workers to transfer production elsewhere, Alvarado said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">During World War II, automakers were more easily able to shift to making tanks and planes because they are close relatives to cars and trucks, Alvarado said.

Meeting the need would be tough enough, but the response has been complicated by a virus that requires people to avoid the kind of close interaction typical in food packaging and distribution.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe\u2019re getting through it,\u201d said Matt Unger, who heads the Des Moines Area Religious Council\u2019s network of 14 pantries. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this as long as we can, as good as we can until we run out of adaptations.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The virus has caused a reversal in how pantries provide food, shifting from letting people select items in what amount to mini-groceries to giving them a sack filled with food. Giving people control over what they select gives them dignity and reduces waste, but giving them pre-filled sacks enables quicker interactions with less chance of passing along the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The sacks also require a lot more work by staff and volunteers who must sort and package items. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That extra work comes even as pantries tell their many older volunteers to stay away.

{"title": "Pressure grows on Trump as hospitals sound virus alarms", "articleDate": "March 19, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By JILL COLVIN and DEB RIECHMANN", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Insisting the federal government is not a \u201cshipping clerk,\u201d President Donald Trump on Thursday called on states to do more to secure their own critically needed masks, ventilators and testing supplies as the pressure mounted on hospitals struggling to cope with a rising number of coronavirus patients.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">During another fast-moving day in the capital, Trump and his administration took additional, once-unthinkable steps to try to contain the pandemic. The State Department issued a new alert urging Americans not to travel abroad under any circumstances. And Trump said the government should take partial ownership of companies bailed out during the pandemic, a step that would mark an extraordinary federal reach into the private sector.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hoping to inject some good news into the dreary outlook, Trump held a White House briefing trying to highlight new efforts underway to find treatments for COVID-19 as infections in the country climbed past 11,000, with at least 168 deaths. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He offered an upbeat promotion of therapeutic drugs in early testing that he said could be \u201ca game-changer\u201d in treating those suffering. But critics quickly accused him of spreading misleading information and overly optimistic projections after the head of the Food and Drug Administration made clear that the drugs Trump discussed were still being tested for their effectiveness and safety. That process takes months and may or may not yield any results.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The FDA later reminded the public in a statement that there are \u201cno FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Capitol Hill, lawmakers worked urgently toward a $1 trillion aid package to prop up households and the U.S. economy that would <a class=\"\" href=\"/0373a78b0aacc49d1f6bd8901c8ccc67\">put money directly into American\u2019s pockets.</a><!-- --> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has proposed making direct payments of $1,200 per person, $2,400 for couples and $500 for each child, according to a copy of the legislation obtained by The Associated Press.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Congress has also been discussing loans that would have to be paid back to shore up airlines and other industries and was working to increase production of medical supplies and build temporary field hospitals under new authorities unlocked when Trump invoked the Defense Production Act Wednesday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the White House, where temperature checks continued and officials and journalists sat separated from one another as they practiced social distancing, Trump also stepped up his criticism of China, chastising the country he had previously praised for not warning the world earlier about a disease that started in Wuhan, but has since spread across the globe.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Indeed, the death toll in Italy from the coronavirus overtook China\u2019s on Thursday, with at least 3,405 deaths in a country with a population of 60 million.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf people would have known about it, it could have... been stopped in place, it could have been stopped right where it came from,\u201d Trump said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cBut now the whole world almost is inflicted with this horrible virus and it\u2019s too bad,\u201d he added, lamenting how the U.S economy was healthy \u201cjust a few weeks ago.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump grew agitated when one reporter noted the economy had essentially ground to a halt. \u201cWe know that,\u201d Trump snapped. \u201cEverybody in the room knows that.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">More than eight weeks after the first U.S. case of the virus was detected, the federal government is still struggling to respond. Testing in the U.S. lags dramatically behind other developed nations, and states still say they cannot conduct wide-scale testing because they don\u2019t have the swabs or other materials necessary to process them.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">And as the number of confirmed cases mounts, doctors and nurses are sounding warnings about the shortage of crucial supplies, including masks and other gear needed to protect health care workers, along with ventilators to treat respiratory symptoms of the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week issued guidance telling health care workers that if no masks are available, they could turn to \u201chomemade\u201d options \u201c(e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Trump insisted against the evidence Thursday that there are more than enough supplies available to meet needs. And he said that it was up to states to obtain them.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While willing to \u201chelp out wherever we can,\u201d he said \u201cgovernors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe federal government\u2019s not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re not a shipping clerk.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">After the briefing, Trump traveled to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has now been tasked with leading the national coronavirus response, for a teleconference with governors \u2014 some of whom have complained about a lack of guidance from Washington.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Again and again during the call, governors said they were having difficulty securing supplies, including the materials needed to process tests, with some sounding panicked. Some said they were competing with the federal government for purchases. Officials in the room, however, insisted there was plenty available on the market to purchase.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Among those expressing concern was Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who told Trump he feared the state would begin to exceed its capacity to deliver health care in as soon as a week.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI\u2019m asking for help in terms of surging our medical capacity here in Louisiana,\u201d he told the president. He said the state was \u201cgoing to do everything we can to mitigate and slow the spread, but in the time that we have, we\u2019ve got to increase our surge capacity. That is my biggest concern.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As the virus threat has become more acute, Trump has begun to describe himself as a \u201cwartime president.\u201d As he and members of Congress craft bailout packages, Trump said he believed the government should take partial ownership of some companies hard hit by the pandemic and aided by taxpayers. Some Republicans in Congress have pushed back on the idea, saying it amounts to the government picking winners and losers, as they criticized President Barack Obama of doing after the 2008 financial crisis. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On the medical front, Trump and Dr. Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, described several existing drugs and treatments currently under testing to see if they can help those with COVID-19. Among them: chloroquine, a drug long used to treat malaria; remdesivir, an experimental antiviral that\u2019s being tried in at least five separate studies; and antibodies culled from the blood of COVID-19 patients when they recover.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Chloroquine is widely available already and could be used off-label, but Hahn said officials want a formal study to get good information on whether it helps people with COVID-19 and is safe. No new and imminent treatments were announced at the briefing.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe\u2019re looking at drugs that are already approved for other indications\u201d as a potential bridge or stopgap until studies are completed on drugs under investigation, Hahn said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Social distancing has proved to be a challenge in the tight quarters of the White House briefing room. When task force members walked out for the briefing, they spread out widely. \u201cWe practice what we preach,\u201d Surgeon General Jerome Adams said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But moments later, the vice president\u2019s press secretary popped out into the briefing room and directed them to move closer together, presumably to make room for her boss. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump, who is at increased risk of serious illness because of his age, stood so close to some of the officials answering questions at the podium that they could not stand fully in front of it.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump took note of the cramped quarters, too, and claimed that social distancing was making the media \u201cnicer.\u201d Yet he later laced into reporters, suggesting he would like to limit briefings to two or three of his favorite supporters. And he assailed some of his coverage, slamming as \u201cfake news\u201d outlets whose reporters have worked to hold his administration accountable for its delayed response. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writer Matthew Perrone contributed to this report.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

ECB head Christine Lagarde said Thursday that the the bond purchase stimulus is not the last word and could be increased if the coronavirus crisis demands that. Lagarde said in an op-ed article to appear in European newspapers Friday that \u201cwe are fully prepared to increase the size of our asset purchase programs and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed.\u201d She said the monetary authority for the 19 countries in the euro currency would \u201cdo everything necessary within our mandate to help the euro area through this crisis.\u201d Lagarde\u2019s words recalled the statement by predecessor Mario Draghi that \u201cwithin our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes\u201d to ensure the euro survived its 2010-2012 debt crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Bank of England on Thursday <a class=\"\" href=\"/678e7a33fdd4d5d8091773fac1b62d7d\">slashed </a><!-- --> its key interest rate to 0.1%, its lowest-ever level, amid global economic turmoil sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">AIRLINES: U.S. airlines are still lobbying for taxpayer cash to keep flying through the virus outbreak, despite failing to win White House support for $29 billion in grants. Thirty airline-industry groups appealed Thursday to congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for immediate and long-term help from the federal government. They asked for aid \u201cin the form of grants, unsecured loans and limited tax measures. The survival of our industry depends on it.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">President Donald Trump has said repeatedly that his administration will help the airlines. But while his administration is supporting $50 billion in secured loans, it did not endorse the grants or billions more in tax relief requested by the airlines. Consumer advocates and many Democrats in Congress want to tie any help for the airlines to specific measures including aid for workers, limits on ticket-change fees, and a ban on stock buybacks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">American Airlines says it plans to cancel 55,000 flights next month and it is grounding nearly half the fleet while expecting plummeting demand for air travel to get even worse. The airline\u2019s president, Robert Isom, detailed the moves in a letter Thursday to employees. The company has cut its international schedule for April by 75% and domestic flying by 30%, with plans to cut even more in May. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\"> Germany\u2019s Lufthansa said that airlines may fail without government assistance if the outbreak lasts for an extended time. The airline has already slashed routes and frozen new hires. Lufthansa said members of its executive board also decided to take a 20% cut in basic pay for 2020.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The International Air Transport Association, which represents around 290 airlines worldwide, on Thursday put the price tag on combined lost revenue to date at $7 billion. It will get a lot worse. The group estimates total costs worldwide could reach $113 billion. The group called for emergency aid of up to $200 billion for airlines globally.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Las Vegas airport is running with reduced operations after an air traffic controller tested positive for the new coronavirus, temporarily closing the control tower. Nearly 500 flights in Las Vegas were canceled by midday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Seven Middle Eastern countries have suspended all commercial flights, while other airlines halted international flights amid a near total collapse in demand for travel. Vietnam Airlines was the latest with a halt to all international flights until the end of April. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The South American country of Guyana, meanwhile, has temporarily closed its two international airports. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">DRIVE-THRU TESTING: Drugstore chain CVS said it has opened a first drive-thru coronavirus testing site in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, but only for first responders and health care workers. Walmart says it will follow in the next two to three days with testing centers for that limited group of people in the Chicago area. Both say they will use the parking-lot testing areas as trial sites for an expanded effort for the general population. The announcements come nearly a week ago after Trump described a government partnership with major businesses to set up drive-thru testing centers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">BONUSES: Walmart also said that it will be giving special bonuses to its hourly employees to reward them for their work in serving customers who are stockpiling toilet paper and other basics. Part-time workers will receive $150 while full-time workers will receive $300 provided they started March 1. The bonuses will be paid out on April 2. It will also move up quarterly bonuses for workers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">SHOPPING IN AN OUTBREAK: The trend toward online shopping has been underway for years and the arrival of the novel coronavirus may be accelerating that shift. Amazon is hiring 100,000 people to fulfill orders. Domino\u2019s Pizza said Thursday that it is hiring about 10,000 workers in the U.S. to meet rising demand for delivery and carryout. Domino\u2019s put out the call for delivery drivers, pizza makers, managers and truck drivers. Domino\u2019s U.S. stores remain open for carryout and it is also offering contact-less delivery. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">DISLODGED: The hotel industry is being decimated as businesses cease travel and one-time tourists take shelter. Hotels were half emptied out last week, according to the analytics firm STR, with occupancy rates falling 24%. In cities particularly hard hit by the virus, like Seattle and San Francisco, occupancy was below 40%, according to STR.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Marriott\u2019s CEO, as well as the son of the hotel company\u2019s founders, have forfeited their salary for the rest of the year as the hotel company tries to slash costs. J.W. Marriott Jr., who serves as chairman, earned $3.2 million in 2018. CEO Arne Sorenson had a base salary of $1.3 million. The pay of other executives will be halved. Marriott occupancy in the U.S. and Europe is less than 25% \u2014 down from a usual rate of nearly 70%. Sorenson said cancellations have reached historic highs.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Greece ordered most hotels to shut down by Sunday and remain closed through all of April. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">FACTORED OUT: More companies are closing factory gates a day after the top U.S. automakers announced a total production shutdown in North America.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc. is indefinitely suspending production at its assembly plant in Fremont, California, at the end of the day Monday. The company says it followed federal guidelines in staying open even though seven Bay Area counties have ordered residents to shelter in place. Alameda County on Tuesday night declared Tesla a \u201cnonessential business\u201d under the county\u2019s shelter-in-place order, but the Fremont factory kept producing. On Thursday, Tesla said it would shut down except for basic operations. The company said its solar factory in New York also will temporarily suspend production, but its battery plant in Nevada and other operations will continue. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Subaru is temporarily closing its only U.S. factory out of concerns for worker safety due to the coronavirus, as well as to adjust for falling sales. The Japanese automaker says the plant in Lafayette, Indiana, will shut down on Monday and remain closed for at least a week. All workers will be paid for the week. The plant has about 5,700 workers.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kia and Volkswagen also said they would suspend production at their U.S. factories. The 2,700-worker Kia plant in West Point, Georgia will be closed Thursday and Friday due to a parts shortage. It will be cleaned and is expected to reopen Monday. Worker pay is being discussed. Volkswagen will halt assembly lines for a week starting Saturday at its Chattanooga, Tennessee, plant that employs 3,800. It\u2019s scheduled to reopen the night of March 29. VW says it will use the time to clean the plant and assess future production. Workers will get full pay, VW says. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Toyota also announced Thursday it will extend the closure of its North American plants until April 6. The plants will close Monday and Tuesday and had been scheduled to reopen Wednesday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">They join General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Nissan and Hyundai in suspending production at North American factories. Auto factories run by BMW and Mercedes-Benz are still running.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hyundai said Thursday that it would close its plant in the Czech Republic for two weeks starting Monday. The plant produced almost 310,000 cars last year and employs some 3,300 people. Auto factories have been closed across much of Europe already. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">MANUFACTURING\u2019S SECOND ACT: Germany-based Beiersdorf, whose brands include Nivea and Coppertone, says it is launching production of medical disinfectant in Europe to support the fight against the virus. Beiersdorf said Thursday that it initially will provide 500 tons of disinfectant for hospitals, medical staff and emergency responders such as police and firefighters. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">CRUCIAL SUPPLY: Supermarkets have become one of the few places where social distancing rules are stretched. Brands like Campbell, which have struggled as more people seek out non-processed foods or those they believe are more fresh, have seen their stock spike. Placer.ai, a data analytics firm, said traffic at Kroger and Albertsons stores rose more than 35% the second week in March. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">British supermarkets have brought in measures to control the coronavirus-induced panic-buying that\u2019s seen many of their shelves emptied and elderly and vulnerable people often unable to get the products they need.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Established companies like Campbell and Hormel are not the only ones seeing demand surge. Blue Apron, which makes fresh meal kits for dinner preparation at home, was threatened with delisting from the New York Stock Exchange not so long ago after its shares fell below the exchange minimum $1. Company shares are up almost 530% this week. Blue Apron said it has seen a sharp increase in consumer demand over the last week and is increasing its capacity to fill those orders. It said it\u2019s hiring workers for temporary and permanent positions in New Jersey and California.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1240486275892662273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Follow AP coverage of the virus </a><!-- --> outbreak at <a class=\"\" href=\"/VirusOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</a><!-- --> and <a class=\"\" href=\"/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</a></p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

It maintains caches of pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and vaccines in secret locations around the nation.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It has never confronted anything on the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The first real use came in the anthrax-by-mail attacks following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but it was the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that prompted the largest use to date, said Christopher McKnight Nichols, associate professor of history at Oregon State University.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe SNS as designed and funded cannot and will not be able to fully accommodate the needs of the entirety of the American people,\u201d Nichols said. The system \u201cis designed to help buy time\u201d and prioritize areas of greatest need, he explained.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">When the virus first hit the U.S., federal officials did focus on a hot spot: the Seattle area.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The country\u2019s first coronavirus death occurred there on Feb. 29. That same day, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee requested almost one-quarter million N95 respirator masks, which fit tightly to the face, and 200,000 surgical masks. which are less protective than respirators but still deemed acceptable by federal health officials when N95 masks are unavailable. The governor also asked for 5,000 eye protectors, 60,000 disposable gowns and 70,000 pairs of gloves.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Six days later, the shipment came in.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThey met our entire request,\u201d said Mike Faulk, a spokesman for the Democratic governor.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A second order resulted in the delivery of more N95 respirators and other equipment, Faulk said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But since then, Washington state has received only about 25% of requests, according to Jessica Baggett of the state\u2019s joint information center. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Other states haven\u2019t gotten what they wanted.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf anyone in the Trump administration is listening, I want to say this very loudly and clearly: We need a better response from the federal government,\u201d Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, told a news conference Monday. \u201cWe need faster access to our personal protective equipment, masks, goggles, gloves, etc. to protect our frontline healthcare workers. I am out of patience at this point.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The state requested hundreds of thousands of respirators, surgical masks, gloves and other protective equipment from the stockpile and received a quarter of that request, said Joseph Wendelken, spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Health.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On March 3, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown asked for 400,000 respirator masks plus gowns, gloves and disposable protective suits, and up to 100 breathing machines in case the outbreak gets out of control. Her office was told Thursday that Oregon would be getting less than one-tenth the requested number of respirator masks, some other gear and no ventilator machines. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe don\u2019t even know when it\u2019s coming,\u201d Brown told reporters. \u201cThe response has been extremely inadequate and absolutely unacceptable. ... It\u2019s exposing not only cracks, but I would say canyons, in our federal health care system.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, said the state has requested equipment which he expects to arrive this week and has no complaints about the Trump administration\u2019s response to such requests.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">One other problem: expired equipment.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Feb. 28 that some items in the U.S. stockpiles have exceeded their manufacturer-designated shelf life. They are nevertheless being sent to hospitals \u201cdue to the potential urgent demand caused by the COVID-19 public health emergency,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/release-stockpiled-N95.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">CDC said</a><!-- -->.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Effective masks are critical because the virus is often absorbed through the mouth or nose from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. But the elastic straps affixing the mask to the face could be degraded and snap, causing the mask to fall and exposing the user to a virus. Or the foam material that touches the nose could be so degraded that it would make the seal around the face ineffective. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kimberly Clark, a company that makes the mask, told customers two years ago that certain models should be disposed of if beyond their shelf life, the CDC said. Users of masks that have exceeded the shelf life should be notified and told to inspect them and make seal checks, the CDC advised. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As of Monday, the Strategic National Stockpile had roughly 10.5 million respirator masks, down from 12 million two days earlier, said a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which manages it. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The stockpile has been working as designed but faces being overwhelmed, said Benjamin Brunjes, an assistant professor and public management specialist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Health experts have previously estimated that demand for masks could reach 300 million per month in a worst-case scenario, he noted.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cHospitals around the Seattle area are already experiencing mask shortages, and other products are likely not far behind,\u201d Brunjes said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Department of Health and Human Services is trying to encourage production, saying it intends to buy 500 million N95 masks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, a Republican, said it\u2019s important for the federal government to release protective gear to health care workers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThey are on the front lines of this,\u201d Husted said. \u201cWe need to ensure that we are supporting them with the resources that they need.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some states appear to have adequate supply of protective equipment, for now.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">California state officials said they had a stockpile of 20 million masks for health care workers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The masks are expired, but the CDC gave them permission to use them anyway. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">AP reporters Michelle R.

It has massive capacity to handle Netflix, YouTube, Zoom and other streaming services. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">True, Netflix has just throttled down its video quality in Europe at the request of authorities there. But the company already stores its programs on servers close to users\u2019 homes already, and there\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s clogging networks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">IF THE INTERNET IS SO STURDY, WHY DOES MY HOME CONNECTION STUTTER?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The problem partly lies in the so-called \u201clast mile,\u201d the link that connects your home to the ultra-high speed internet backbone.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Most U.S. homes get their internet from cable companies and thus connect to the broader network via coaxial cable, a legacy of the cable TV era. These connections provide faster \u201cdownstream\u201d speeds to your home than \u201cupstream\u201d speeds back to the internet. Since videoconferencing sends equal amounts of data both ways, simultaneous sessions can clog the upstream channel and disrupt service for the entire household.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">If that happens, one quick solution is to have some family members switch to audio-only, which conserves bandwidth. This also applies to anyone in multiplayer online games, where \u2014 per a wag on Twitter \u2014 the banter between players often resembles conference calls with occasional shooting.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">You could also order a service upgrade, although that might not be strictly necessary. Some providers are temporarily offering more bandwidth, particularly for families with school-age children, in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Others have dropped service caps that charge extra when data usage passes a certain threshold. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The relatively few U.S. households with their own direct fiber-optic connections have the same bandwidth in both directions and shouldn\u2019t experience serious hiccups.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">DOES MY HOME NETWORK NEED AN UPGRADE?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It might. Start with your internet modem, the device that most likely has a coax cable connecting it to your wall. Your internet provider often rents the modem to you.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">If it\u2019s several years old, it\u2019s probably time to ask your provider if upgrading the modem\u2019s internal software, or replacing the modem entirely, will help. Older modems often can\u2019t deliver the full bandwidth you\u2019re paying for to your household. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Next up is your Wi-Fi router. If you have cable, it may be built into your modem. If you haven\u2019t already, try moving it to a more central location in your home or apartment; that will ensure bandwidth is distributed more equally.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Or you can add more access points and distribute Wi-Fi with a \u201cmesh\u201d network. Newer routers let you add several satellite stations that boost your signal throughout the house, though you might have to arrange that with your provider.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">One more possibility: You can connect some devices directly to the router with ethernet cables instead of using Wi-Fi.

But Burr and all the other senators pushed back strongly against suggestions that they used sensitive government information to protect their financial well-being.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The actions by the handful of senators, whose stock transactions are documented in mandatory filings to the Senate, attracted heavy scrutiny as the coronavirus pandemic continues to disrupt everyday life, wiping out jobs and personal wealth. At a moment when political leaders are urging Americans to make shared sacrifices to stop the virus, some questioned whether lawmakers were doing the same. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt appears that in a time of crisis, these senators chose instead to serve themselves, violating the public trust and abdicating their duty,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, the director the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed a Senate ethics complaint against Burr and Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia. \u201cThey must be immediately investigated.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The mandatory disclosures senators must make do not detail specific amounts of stock sales. Instead, they give a range in dollars of the value of each transaction.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Senate records show that Burr and his wife sold between roughly $600,000 and $1.7 million in more than 30 separate transactions in late January and mid-February, just before the market began to plummet and government health officials began to sound alarms about <a class=\"\" href=\"/VirusOutbreak\">the virus</a><!-- -->. Several of the stocks were in companies that own hotels.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a statement Friday, Burr said he had asked for the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate, \u201cunderstanding the assumption many could make in hindsight.\u201d He acknowledged selling the stocks because of the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Burr said he relied \u201csolely on public news reports,\u201d specifically CNBC\u2019s daily health and science reporting out of Asia, to make the financial decisions. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There is no indication that Burr, who does not plan to run for reelection in 2022, was acting on inside information. The intelligence panel he leads did not have any briefings on the pandemic the week when most of the stocks were sold, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person declined to be identified to discuss confidential committee activity. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Senators did receive a closed-door briefing on the virus on Jan. 24, which was public knowledge. A separate briefing was held Feb. 12 by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which Burr is a member of. It\u2019s unclear if he attended either session. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The stock sales were first reported by ProPublica and The Center for Responsive Politics. Most of them came on Feb. 13, just before Burr made a speech in Washington, D.C., in which he predicted severe consequences from the virus, according to audio obtained by National Public Radio and released Thursday. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Burr told the small North Carolina State Society audience that the virus was \u201cmuch more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history\u201d and \u201cprobably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Burr\u2019s remarks were darker than what he was saying publicly, and came as President Donald Trump was still <a class=\"\" href=\"/67a9a72531ca2e332bea9225cec2fda5\">downplaying the severity of the virus</a><!-- -->.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a tweet on Thursday, Burr said that Americans were already being warned about the effects of the virus when he made the speech to the North Carolina State Society. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe message I shared with my constituents is the one public health officials urged all of us to heed as coronavirus spread increased,\u201d Burr wrote. \u201cBe prepared.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Burr\u2019s North Carolina colleague, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, tweeted that the ethics review of the stock sales was appropriate. Asked in the Capitol about Burr\u2019s sales, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not respond.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Burr was not the only lawmaker to sell off stocks before the market slide. Loeffler, a new senator <a class=\"\" href=\"/28b2e7bf84e1909502c6b4c22286b658\">up for reelection this year</a><!-- -->, sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in late January and February, as senators began to get briefings on the virus, according to records. So did fellow Georgia Sen. David Perdue, another Republican lawmaker running for reelection, and also Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Loeffler\u2019s sales were first reported by the Daily Beast. In a tweet early Friday morning, she called it a \u201cridiculous &amp; baseless attack.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cInvestment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband\u2019s knowledge or involvement,\u201d she tweeted. She said she was informed of the decisions three weeks after they were made. Loeffler is married to Jeffrey Sprecher, the chairman and CEO of financial powerhouse Intercontinental Exchange.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Loeffler and her husband offloaded anywhere between about $1.1 million and $2.8 million in stock. But they plunged between $315,000 and $650,000 into real estate investment firm Blackstone, tech company Oracle and Citrix Systems \u2014 a company that develops workplace and telecommuting software. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Perdue sold off as much as $770,000 in stock in February. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In more than 40 separate transactions, he dropped a wide array of holdings, including as much as $165,000 in stock in the Nevada-based casino company that owns Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. The industry has been battered by the virus, which has led casinos to shut down. In the days after he sold the shares, the value of Caesars Entertainment Corporation stock cratered. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He also purchased shares in Disney and Delta, two companies hard hit by the pandemic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Perdue attended a Feb. 25 Senate Armed Services committee meeting where spread of the coronavirus was discussed. In the days after, he invested as much as $260,000 in pharmaceutical company Pfizer, according to a disclosure.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Perdue spokeswoman Casey Black said the senator has an outside adviser manage his investments and \u201cgoes above and beyond to fully comply with the law.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Feinstein reported that her husband sold off between $1.5 million and $6 million worth of stock in Allogene Therapeutics more than a month ago. The San Francisco-based biotech company researches and develops cures for cancer.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Feinstein, who also sits on the intelligence panel, said in a statement that she didn\u2019t attend the Jan. 24 briefing and had no input in her husband\u2019s decisions. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis company is unrelated to any work on the coronavirus and the sale was unrelated to the situation,\u201d she said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Inhofe, meanwhile, sold anywhere between roughly $395,000 and $850,000 worth of stock he held in multiple companies in late January and early February, according to a disclosure. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Inhofe tweeted that he has no involvement in his investment decisions after asking his financial adviser to move him out of stocks and into mutual funds \u201cto avoid any appearance of controversy.\u201d He said he made that move in December 2018, shortly after becoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">President Donald Trump, who has faced persistent questions about whether his family is profiting from his office, declined to say whether the sales should be investigated.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI don\u2019t know because I\u2019d have to look at it.\u201d He said of the senators: \u201cI find them to be honorable people.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">______</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro and Padmananda Rama contributed.</p>"]}

As an alternative, the airline is considering slashing pay, or a combination of job and pay cuts.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">So far, no major U.S. airline has announced layoffs because of the COVID-19 outbreak, although two small regional carriers have said they will shut down next month. The big airlines have canceled tens of thousands of flights, grounded hundreds of airplanes, and asked employees to take unpaid leave or early retirement. Delta said 13,000 employees have agreed to unpaid leave.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">United officials did not explain what they consider sufficient aid, but cash grants appear to be the stumbling block in talks between airline industry representatives and Washington.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The U.S. airline industry is lobbying for $29 billion in cash grants and a similar amount in zero-interest loans. The White House and Senate Republicans are offering up to $50 billion in loans but no grants. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some lawmakers are resisting what they consider a bailout, while others want to impose conditions on airlines \u2013 such as new consumer protections opposed by the industry \u2013 to any relief.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Airlines are against proposals from some lawmakers to attach conditions such as new consumer protections. They have indicated that they could accept some limits on grant money, such as using the cash to protect jobs instead of buying back stock or paying executive bonuses.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cLoans alone are not sufficient,\u201d the trade group Airlines for America said in a statement.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Criticism of the airline stock buybacks has clearly touched a nerve. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Delta Air Lines has spent more than $10 billion buying back its own stock in the last five years, according to data from FactSet. CEO Ed Bastian said Friday the company has spent more than $20 billion on new planes and other improvements and another $19 billion in profit-sharing and pensions contributions for employees in that time.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">United and Delta recently suspended share repurchases.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Analysts at Moody\u2019s Investors Service said Friday that large airlines have enough cash and borrowing ability to manage through \u201ca fairly significant short-term disruption\u201d through June \u2014 and through September if the outbreak\u2019s impact is more moderate. Smaller airlines and those with less cash will be more vulnerable, the analysts said, \u201cand there is potential for some airlines to collapse within a short period\u201d without more aid from shareholders or governments.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Bastian said the situation facing the airlines is growing more dire by the day. He said revenue for the April-through-June quarter will be $10 billion less than a year ago, a decline of 80%. Delta, the world\u2019s biggest airline, is burning through $50 million in case every day, he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Smaller, so-called regional airlines may be hurting even more.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Faye Malarkey Black, president of a trade group for those carriers, said Friday that Senate Republicans\u2019 proposal for $58 billion in loans, of which $8 billion would be earmarked for cargo carriers, \u201cdoes not help save the regional airline industry or our 70,000 employees.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Black said regional airlines, which operate flights for bigger carriers under brand names including Delta Connection, American Eagle and United Express, won\u2019t survive without direct financial aid or unsecured loans in which amounts spent to keep workers are forgiven. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Two of the regional carriers, Compass Airlines and Trans States Airlines, have said they will shut down in early April. </p>"]}

(AP) \u2014 The lobbying arm of the U.S. coal industry is asking for hundreds of millions of dollars in royalty relief, tax cuts and other breaks to help companies ride out the financial crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">National Mining Association President Rich Nolan made the request in a letter sent this week to the White House and the leaders of the House and Senate. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The benefits that Nolan asked Congress to provide could total more than $800 million a year for coal companies, based on last year\u2019s payments by the industry to the federal government.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The request includes a $220 million cut to a tax aimed at covering beneficiary payments for black lung disease in miners, a 50% cut in mine reclamation fees that would be worth $75 million, and suspending or eliminating royalty payments that totaled $527 million last year, according to the association.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Even before the current economic upheaval, the coal mining industry was in sharp decline as utilities across the nation switch to cleaner-burning natural gas and renewable energy sources.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">With financial institutions under pressure from environmentalists to divest from coal, Nolan also said more access to credit was needed to help companies keep mines open. He described it as a matter of national security and said that without easier access to credit, operations at hundreds of mines employing tens of thousands of miners could be threatened.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe coal industry is absolutely critical to securing a domestic, secure supply of affordable energy,\u201d he said. \u201cAs global supply chains are disrupted...American-mined coal is here when it is needed.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The request was blasted by conservationists who said it amounted to a corporate giveaway and would sharply reduce revenue for coal mining states that get a share of all royalty payments.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cCEOs are seeking to manipulate a global public health crisis for private gain.

That is in addition to $1 trillion in 14-day loans it is offering every week. Banks, so far, have not borrowed nearly as much as the New York Fed is offering, and the loans are quickly repaid. None of the funding is from taxpayer dollars. Wall Street analysts say the huge number is intended to calm markets by demonstrating that the Fed\u2019s ability to lend short-term is nearly unlimited. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Fed is also buying Treasury bonds at a furious pace, and will soon run through the $500 billion in purchases it announced on Sunday. It is also accelerating its purchases of mortgage-backed securities. Most analysts expect they will buy more.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe Fed has just worked with unprecedented speed,\u201d said Steven Friedman, a former economist at the New York Fed and senior macroeconomist at MacKay Shields, an asset manager. \u201cI think there will be no hesitation on their part about buying as many Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as necessary.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">All the Fed\u2019s emergency steps are intended to pump cash into a financial system that has seen a spike in demand for dollars as investors unload Treasuries, municipal bonds, and other securities. With the economy likely in recession, banks, money market funds and other institutional investors are increasingly wary about holding securities that may lose value. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Companies will see revenue and earnings plunge, while local and state governments are likely to see lower tax revenue. That makes it harder for them to borrow. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThere is a growing certainty that we\u2019re facing an economic contraction, so it\u2019s natural for investors to become more concerned about risk,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThe Fed is trying to play the role of shock absorber.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The flood of selling has pushed up short-term borrowing costs for companies, states and cities, and banks, even as the Fed has tried to lower interest rates more broadly by cutting its benchmark rate on Sunday to nearly zero. The Fed\u2019s efforts are intended to offset those increases in borrowing costs, which could exacerbate the economic downturn by forcing companies and local governments to lay off even more workers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThey\u2019ve effectively thrown the kitchen sink at the markets and the economy,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist for TD Securities. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Goldberg said the Fed\u2019s efforts are starting to bear fruit, with some short-term rates stabilizing. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Fed is also trying to clear markets by ramping up its purchases. On Friday, it bought $75 billion of Treasurys and $47 billion of mortgage-backed securities. By comparison, when the Fed engaged in long-term asset purchases in its third round of quantitative easing in 2012, it bought $45 billion a month. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">All told, the New York Fed has bought about $280 billion of Treasuries, more than half of its planned $500 billion. On Friday it said will buy $100 billion of mortgage-backed bonds next week, including $40 billion on Monday. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Those purchases provide more cash to banks, which are also seeing many corporate clients draw down billions of dollars on their credit lines. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Goldberg noted that the value of outstanding Treasurys has more than doubled since 2010, after the financial crisis, but banks are less willing to hold them, which makes the Treasury market less liquid. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That is a problem, because the $17 trillion Treasury market, the largest in the world, influences a wide range of borrowing costs, including rates for mortgages, credit cards and auto loans. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Fed also announced Friday that it would expand an emergency lending program, which it just launched Wednesday, to loan money to banks, which would use the funds to purchase highly rated municipal bonds from money market mutual funds or from muni bond funds. The goal is to stabilize the $3.8 trillion muni bond market and ensure states and cities and other public entities, including hospitals, can borrow at low cost. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The emergency lending program, known as the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, was first used during the 2008 financial crisis, but its expansion to include muni bonds is a new step that wasn\u2019t taken back then. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">States and cities are facing a looming cash crunch as revenue from sales taxes and other levies are likely to fall sharply in the coming weeks and months. At the same time, many public institutions are facing higher costs, particularly hospitals and other health programs. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Fed has in the past come under criticism from Democrats in Congress for not using its emergency lending powers to assist struggling local governments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday to consider doing so. The Fed said its action Friday was in response to turmoil in financial markets. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Also Friday, the Fed said it would expand its currency exchanges with five central banks, including by providing week-long exchanges, or currency swaps, every day rather than once a week.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Fed provides dollars to overseas central banks because some business is conducted overseas in dollars and foreign banks also provide dollar-denominated loans to their customers.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">This story has been updated to correct the size of the Treasury market.

{"title": "Trump angrily defends his handling of coronavirus pandemic", "articleDate": "March 21, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By JILL COLVIN and JONATHAN LEMIRE", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defending his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, an angry President Donald Trump on Friday lashed out at reporters and broke with his own health officials on the science of the outbreak.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump said he was tapping the Defense Production Act to order American businesses to manufacture and send supplies, like testing kits, ventilators and masks, to hospitals preparing to be overwhelmed by a wave of coronavirus cases. But he gave conflicting accounts as to when he officially invoked the rarely used order \u2014 and even if he had ultimately done so \u2014 and did not specify which companies he was marshaling for the effort. Trump had said earlier in the week he would tap the act as needed; he then added Friday that he has put that \u201cin gear.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president also announced an effective closure of the U.S. border with Mexico, prohibiting most travel except for trade. That brings it in line with the restriction on the Canadian border earlier this week. The U.S. is also suspending interest on student loans to help young people cope with job losses and the financial crunch.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As Congress debated a financial relief package that could reach $1 trillion, officials again urged Americans to maintain social distancing. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, applauded strict new measures put in place by the governors of California and New York to limit mobility.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But Trump and Fauci broke openly during the White House briefing on the possible effectiveness of new drugs being explored to treat the virus. Trump said he believed that a combination of medications he announced Thursday would work to treat the virus. Fauci said no such declaration could be made without testing, again highlighting the sharp divide between data-driven health officials and a president who admits he follows his gut.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president spent much of the Friday briefing in a fury, sparring with reporters he deemed overly critical of the response. And he again painted an unrealistically rosy picture of the outlook, as doctors and nurses have already made desperate appeals for help even as the anticipated wave of new patients has yet to hit.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump scoffed at questions about continued testing shortfalls and deficiencies in medical supplies, suggesting that even mentioning the issues was problematic. When asked to speak directly to those marooned at home and frightened, Trump voiced objection to the question itself.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter,\u201d Trump responded.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think it\u2019s a very bad signal that you\u2019re putting out to the American people,\u201d he added. \u201cThe American people are looking for answers and they\u2019re looking for hope. And you\u2019re doing sensationalism.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Vice President Mike Pence, when asked the same question later in the briefing, responded, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Be vigilant.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">More than 200 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S., and sickness from the disease is on the rise, with hospitals at risk of being overrun. Most people who get it have only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. </p>", "<p class=\"social-caption Component-root-0-2-85 Component-caption-0-2-82\">Virus US State Table: Table tracks the number of cases, recoveries and deaths for the US including its territories.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he implored Trump during a phone call Friday morning to invoke the Korean War-era act immediately to order the manufacture of ventilators and other critically needed medical gear. The president told Schumer he would and then could be heard on the telephone yelling to someone in his office to do it now, said Schumer\u2019s spokesman, Justin Goodman.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Later at the briefing, Trump said he had actually activated the measure Thursday night. He declined to reveal any companies he had ordered to step up production, though, and then walked back his claim, saying, \u201cYou know, so far, we haven\u2019t had to\u201d because companies are volunteering.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president and the Cabinet officials who briefed reporters focused on the border as they moved to restrict the entry of people without documentation. This follows a stepped-up State Department travel advisory telling Americans they should not leave the country.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On another front, Trump said the Education Department will not enforce standardized testing requirements for students in elementary through high school for the current year. Under federal education law, states are required to administer standardized tests every school year.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAmericans from every walk of life are coming together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are winning and we are going to win this war.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The administration is trying to overcome its inability to provide the needed masks, ventilators and other supplies to hospitals on the verge of being overwhelmed by coronavirus patients. Already doctors and nurses have been making desperate public pleas. And numerous local officials, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, have warned that their medical facilities will shortly run out of vital supplies, endangering both patients and health care workers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have been working toward an aid package to prop up households and the U.S. economy that would put money directly into Americans\u2019 pockets. The president has embraced the stimulus, believing it is needed to stabilize the economy and stock markets, which have been pummeled by the crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"social-caption Component-root-0-2-85 Component-caption-0-2-82\">Virus US State Map: State by state count of confirmed cases in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Mere weeks ago, Trump expected to be campaigning for reelection on the strength of a robust economy and now the nation is staring at a recession, if not worse \u2014 a difficult hand for any incumbent to play.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writers Matthew Perrone and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

{"title": "Trump keeps talking during market hours; stocks keep tanking", "articleDate": "March 21, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By AAMER MADHANI", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 When President Donald Trump speaks, financial markets gyrate and quiver in real time. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But that hasn\u2019t stopped the president from holding forth almost daily about the coronavirus pandemic and its economic implications without waiting until markets have closed for the day.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While many of his predecessors worked consciously to not affect the markets, Trump has overtly made market movements and performance a measure of his effectiveness and central to his argument for a second term.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Earlier this week, public health officials announced a surge of infections in the U.S. as leading economists predicted unemployment spiking to 10% or more. Trump, meanwhile, took the White House podium in the middle of the trading day to offer an optimistic take on his administration\u2019s response to the crisis. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cOne of the elements that is being worked on very much so on the Hill is to keep the jobs going so that when we do get rid of the virus, we\u2019re going to be able to just really...go like a rocket,\u201d said Trump on Thursday as at the market spiked more than 300 points, then dove into negative territory and then inched back into positive territory over the course of his 77-minute press conference. \u201cI think the economy is going to be fantastic.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president headed to the same place again on Friday while the markets were open for an even longer news conference, where he vacillated between expressing optimism and lashing out about \u201cnasty\u201d journalists\u2019 negativity. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Amid more difficult news\u2014the number of confirmed infections around the globe surpassed 250,000 cases\u2014the Dow Jones industrial average closed down more than 4.5 percent on Friday. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the end of the market\u2019s heaviest losses in more than 30 years, the market closed at 19,173.98, below where it stood on the day before Trump was inaugurated and erased the so-called \u201cTrump bump\u201d that he\u2019s pointed to throughout his presidency as evidence of his prowess as the economic steward.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nevertheless, in the midst of one of the most volatile moments ever for the U.S. economy, Trump has wagered that his voice is the daily balm needed to soothe investor concerns. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Over the course of the last eight days--all on which he held extended news conferences about the coronavirus response in the midst of trading -- his comments haven\u2019t stopped the bleeding. The Dow has lost more than 17% since March 13, and has plummeted more than 34% since the market hit an all-time high Feb. 19.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The president\u2019s decision to offer daily affirmations to the health of the stock market, and the economy writ large, is not surprising. But no president has tied his fortunes to Wall Street more closely than Trump, who until the market crash bragged that the rising stock market was evidence of his success leading the economy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cMaybe, he should take it offline,\u201d\u2019 said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody Analytics. \u201cBut this president? He\u2019s not going to do that.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush avoided talking about the stock market with substance, let alone trying to impact the market in the midst of trading. Bill Clinton took to heart his economic adviser Robert Rubin\u2019s advice that markets go up and markets go down. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Barack Obama was ridiculed as the stock-picker-in-chief less than two months into office when he suggested in the midst of a market slide that it was a good time to buy undervalued stocks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For much of his next six years in office, the 44th president was often measured when even talking about the improved health of the economy: his first term started in throes of the Great Recession but he left office with 75 straight months of job growth. By the latter part of his presidency, Obama began claiming credit for the bull market on occasion.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe stock market is booming,\u201d Obama declared in a speech in a July 2014 speech in Kansas City.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Those close to Trump said he was fully aware that the coronavirus posed an enormous threat to the very same once-booming markets he touted as the calling card of his presidency, even as he was publicly downplaying concerns about the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the weeks that the pandemic ballooned into a public health emergency, Trump had become increasingly frustrated as he privately expressed concerns to his advisers about the effect the virus could have on the markets and ultimately his reelection effort, according to White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump throughout his presidency has viewed the market\u2019s performance as his \u201cdaily report card\u201d of his job performance, Zandi said. With the pandemic thrusting the economy toward a recession, Zandi said that Trump now appears to be turning to the market for an \u201chourly report card\u201d to gauge the effectiveness of his response.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIn the past, sometimes it worked and sometimes it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Zandi said of the president\u2019s years-long cheerleading of the market. \u201cRecently, it hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s in fact, as of late, done less to instill confidence and more to upset investors. They don\u2019t view his actions as very productive in terms of this crisis. It\u2019s worked against him.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Throughout his presidency, Trump has used off-the-cuff diatribes to try to shame major, publicly-traded companies whose business dealings are at odds with his political interests, tapped out timely, friendly tweets about China\u2019s Xi Jinping to calm market concerns about trade wars, and repeatedly berated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about the central bank\u2019s policies during market dips.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump has repeatedly made clear that the battered market is top of his mind, as trillions of dollars in wealth and nearly all the gains for the Dow Jones Industrial tallied since his inauguration have been erased. He has sought to will a comeback with his daily updates about his administration\u2019s efforts to contain the virus in the midst of trading day, Zandi said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It mostly hasn\u2019t worked.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump held a Rose Garden press conference on March 13, just before the New York Stock Exchange closed for the weekend, to declare a national emergency, to announce greater availability of virus testing kits were in the pipeline, and to declare he was ordering the purchase of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Later that weekend, he boasted during another news conference that the market responded to his performance with its biggest single-day gain ever. Left unsaid by the president was the fact that market had its single-worst day since the 1987 Black Monday the day before the record gain.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think we should do one of them every day, perhaps. How about five times a day?\u201d Trump remarked. \u201cWe\u2019ll do one five times a day. But that was something to watch and \u2014 I had no idea.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The huge Friday gains that Trump bragged came from his market-whispering were followed by a wipe-out Monday that saw a historic, nearly 3,000-point slide for the Dow. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Investors dumped stocks after the Fed\u2019s surprise move on Sunday evening to cut interest rates to near zero, a move that appeared to only exacerbate investor worries about a global recession. The Fed rate cut came the day after Trump again publicly berated Powell over lending rates.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Jason Furman, a Harvard University economist who served as Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, said Trump should provide important coronavirus updates whenever he and his team sees fit. But Furman also advised that Trump should \u201clet the stock market take care of itself.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said the \u201cgenie is out of the bottle\u201d with Trump\u2019s consistent attempts to shape the market through Twitter and the media. And with the global nature of the marketplace, when Trump makes his comments remains less important than the substance of his remarks, she said..</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis is where facts matter, information matters and very focused communication matters,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cHis experts should be all the focus. His job should be to be the steward right now. Often, the alpha dog isn\u2019t the first one in the pack.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u2014\u2014-</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed reporting to this article.</p>"]}

{"title": "Imports of medical supplies plummet as demand in US soars", "articleDate": "March 21, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By MARTHA MENDOZA and JULIET LINDERMAN", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The critical shortage of medical supplies across the U.S., including testing swabs, protective masks, surgical gowns and hand sanitizer, can be tied to a sudden drop in imports, mostly from China, The Associated Press has found.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trade data shows the decline in shipments started in mid-February after the spiraling coronavirus outbreak in China led the country to shutter factories and disrupted ports. Some emergency rooms, hospitals and clinics in the U.S. have now run out of key medical supplies, while others are rationing personal protective equipment like gloves and masks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The United States counts on receiving the vast majority of its medical supplies from China, where the coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people and killed more than 3,200. When Chinese medical supply factories began coming back on line last month, their first priority was their own hospitals. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The government required makers of N95 masks to sell all or part of their production internally instead of shipping masks to the U.S. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The most recent delivery of medical-grade N95 masks arrived from China about a month ago, on Feb. 19. And as few as 13 shipments of non-medical N95 masks have arrived in the past month \u2014 half as many as arrived the same month last year. N95 masks are used in industrial settings, as well as hospitals, and filter out 95% of all airborne particles, including ones too tiny to be blocked by regular masks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Governors across the country are becoming panicked as states run out of equipment. President Donald Trump has urged them to buy masks on the open market, but few if any are available.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWithout adequate protection, more of our hospital staff could become ill, which would mean there wouldn\u2019t be people to care for patients,\u201d said Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association\u2019s vice president of quality and patient safety policy. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some hospitals are down to just a day or two of personal protective equipment, she said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The AP found that in the past month, hand sanitizer and swab imports both dropped by 40%, N95 mask imports were down 55%, and surgical gowns, typically sourced from China, were at near normal levels because the sourcing was shifted to Honduras.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Typically, medical supplies are delivered along both coasts. But almost all the supplies that did arrive in the past month came into Newark, New Jersey, across the country from the earliest and most severe coronavirus outbreaks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The AP identified the falling imports by looking at shipment data maintained by ImportGenius and Panjiva Inc., services that independently track global trade.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In mid-February, the World Health Organization warned that global demand for safety gear for medical providers was 100 times higher than normal. Prices were 20 times higher, stockpiles were depleted and there was a four- to six-month backlog. Despite this, federal contracting data shows there was no big effort at that point to submit orders.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trade policies haven\u2019t helped. Tariffs on medical supplies made them more expensive, and they were only lifted March 5, even though health care associations asked the administration last year to exempt items like masks, gloves and gowns. And now countries including South Korea, India and Taiwan are blocking exports of medical supplies to save them for their own citizens, leaving the U.S. with fewer options. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe lag time could be weeks. It could be upward of months,\u201d said Khatereh Calleja, CEO of the Healthcare Supply Chain Association. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Doctors, nurses and first responders in the U.S. are resorting to spraying their masks with bleach at the end of each day and hanging them up at home to dry to use for another day, according to the American College of Emergency Physicians.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThere is a little bit of anxiety, as you can imagine, going to work and not knowing if you will have enough personal protective equipment,\u201d said Dr. David Tan, president of the National Association of EMS Physicians.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The decline in swabs included multiple varieties, not just ones needed to test for COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has for weeks warned state and local health departments about shortages of swabs, which are needed for the testing that is critical to containing the pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Even over-the-counter medical shipments are decreasing. Ten shipping containers filled with medical thermometers arrived at U.S. ports a year ago this month. But in the last 30 days, there were just five. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hand sanitizer, also commonly sourced from China, has disappeared from U.S. stores, and it may stay scarce. Last year by this time, 223 shipments had arrived. This year, since January, just 157 shipments have come.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The shortages affect patients because they can\u2019t get tested and their providers may be carrying the virus from one person to the next. But the far greater risk is to medical personnel: Already, there are reports of dozens of doctors, nurses and medical staff who have contracted the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nurses across the country report that they are not receiving the proper personal protective equipment and their hospitals don\u2019t have the isolation rooms they need to safely care for COVID-19 patients, according to National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s not safe at all. Nobody is safe,\u201d said Consuelo Vargas, an emergency room nurse at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. On Friday morning, after a possible exposure at work, she went to a local hardware store and bought all the painter booties and jumpsuits they had to wear while caring for people. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating because we feel like health care workers are being asked for a lot \u2014 and that\u2019s fine, we can do our job. We\u2019re just asking for the equipment we need,\u201d she said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The shortage doesn\u2019t affect only health care. The humanitarian medical firm Direct Relief thought it was heading into 2020 well-stocked, with several million N95 masks. The organization had increased its orders in 2019 after massive wildfires in the West filled cities with smoke, squeezing its supplies in recent years.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But then bushfires overwhelmed Australia with smoky skies and so Direct Relief began sending the masks there, vice president Tony Morain said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">When the coronavirus hit China, the organization began shipping the masks to Wuhan \u2014 the outbreak\u2019s epicenter \u2014 in an effort to contain the disease. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Morain said they\u2019ve ordered 2 million more masks and are awaiting the shipments. Those typically take at least five weeks to arrive: two weeks to make the masks, two weeks of shipping and a week to get through the port. Meanwhile, he said, Direct Relief has received well over 100 requests from hospitals and health centers down to their last boxes.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In an effort to fill the gap, Minnesota-based 3M is running its Aberdeen, South Dakota, plant around the clock, producing millions of N95 masks per month. The company is also ramping up production of surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions, CEO Mike Roman said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nonetheless, one federal contract with 3M for $4.8 million of N95 masks dated March 12 says the masks will be delivered April 30 \u2014 seven weeks later, according to public contract data. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A number of Chinese companies told the AP this week that they will be resuming exports \u2014 which bring higher prices \u2014 but that they are overwhelmed and can\u2019t meet demand. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cChinese mask manufacturers have received too many orders from abroad, but have no time to produce all of them and make a delivery,\u201d said David Peng, manager of Ningbo Buy Best International Trading Co. Ltd.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trade data shows importers have managed to maintain some supplies by shifting to factories outside China. Shipments of surgical gowns, for example, have dropped less than 5% since December, since they are now coming from Honduras. The same is true for medical gloves, which are now primarily coming from South Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The federal government said a national stockpile was being made available at the state level, but governors said they weren\u2019t getting what they need.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think every governor in the United States has been banging on the door of the federal government with respect to the stockpile. We certainly have, and we\u2019re going to continue to,\u201d Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said at a news conference this week.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California-San Francisco, said he was alarmed by new CDC advice for hospitals that run out of masks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cFor the CDC to say people can wear bandanas is actually quite frightening,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought the CDC would say something like that. We\u2019re in the United States of America in 2020, and we have a recommendation to use bandanas?\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing, reporter Steve LeBlanc in Boston, reporter Michael Biesecker in Washington and data editor Meghan Hoyer contributed to this story.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Contact the AP\u2019s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

(AP) \u2014 Some Kansas legislators say they didn\u2019t understand how much power the governor has in emergencies until Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly <a class=\"\" href=\"/8e5672095558ab92d7505f2a06f9a9b9\">closed K-12 schools </a><!-- --> for the rest of the semester and <a href=\"https://governor.kansas.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20-06-Executed.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">ordered a six-week halt to new evictions and mortgage foreclosures</a><!-- --> amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kansas is typical in granting its governor broad, temporary powers to deal with an emergency. Other governors have closed schools, directed non-essential businesses to shut down temporarily and banned public gatherings.
