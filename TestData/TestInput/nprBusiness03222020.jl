The games offer a solution to some who are looking for a way to hang out with friends and family \u2014 while upholding the guidelines on social distancing, including orders to stay at home.</p>", "<p>Jackbox Games is a Chicago-based video game company that makes party games, including the trivia game <em>You Don't Know Jack</em>. Its games are designed for people in a room to play together.</p>", "<p>Last weekend, Jackbox saw traffic \"comparable to Thanksgiving weekend, which is a very busy time of year for us,\" according to CEO Mike Bilder. \"Across the board we've just seen a lot of additional activity over a typical weekend.\"</p>", "<p>Bilder says that part of that uptick is people staying at home and enjoying indoor activities together. But others are using the games in non-traditional ways, using streaming software to play together virtually. Last week, Jackbox published <a href=\"https://jackboxgames.com/how-to-play-jackbox-games-with-friends-and-family-remotely/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=remoteguide&amp;utm_campaign=remoteguide&amp;utm_content=remoteguide\">a guide</a> to playing remotely with friends and family, using Skype, Zoom or Google Hangouts.</p>", "<p>Many gamers use the free voice app <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/\">Discord </a>to talk to each other while playing online together. The company says its account sign-ups are up 200% over last week \u2014 though Discord notes that not all sign-ups are necessarily for gaming, as the app can also be used for distance learning, among other things.</p>", "<p>LingLing Lau, 34, is one of those who is moving her gaming online as her normal life is upended. She lives in Chicago and usually meets up with friends every Wednesday to play the five-on-five arcade game <a href=\"https://killerqueenarcade.com/\">Killer Queen</a>.</p>", "<p>\"Before all this, most of my time that I spent gaming was playing at the arcade with people,\" Lau says. \"I'm definitely very extroverted, so it's hard to not be able to see your friends face-to-face and hang out with them.\"</p>", "<p>In recent days, Lau and her friends have been meeting up virtually to play Jackbox games. The games lend themselves to playing remotely, she says, because only one person needs to own the game. She can launch it from her computer, stream it on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch</a>, then share the stream so her friends can play along on their phones.</p>", "<p>She says that social distancing has motivated her and her friends to be more proactive about staying in touch and planning evenings to play games together virtually.</p>", "<p>\"It's certainly not the same as being able to see people in person,\" Lau says. \"But I think for me it's been nice. It's brought some lightness to this whole situation.\"</p>", "<p>Game developers are adapting, too \u2014 even changing game rules to cater to the new reality of people staying at home.</p>", "<p>Niantic, Inc. makes the popular games <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go</em> and <em>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</em>. Both games usually reward players for leaving home and walking around to collect virtual items.</p>", "<p>But last week Niantic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NianticHelp/status/1238605977278013440\">announced</a> it was eliminating walking requirements in its battle games. It also made it easier for players to collect virtual items in their own homes, rather than out in the world.</p>", "<p>That's been a boon to Daysha Lawrence, 41, of North Canton, Ohio. A faculty member at the local community college, Lawrence is now working remotely and her 8-year-old son Maxwell is home from school. During breaks they'll play <em>Minecraft </em>or <em>Harry Potter</em> together \u2014 and it's easier now that the rule changes allow them to stay indoors.</p>", "<p>In the past, they would go to the park to collect items for the Harry Potter game \u2014 but now the ingredients they need to make virtual potions are found in their house.</p>", "<p>\"They're making it so that we're able to access a lot of the same features of the game as we are trying to practice social distancing and isolating ourselves,\" Lawrence says.</p>", "<p>Some serious gamers say that these homebound times are changing which games they feel like playing.</p>", "<p>Kat Safreed, 24, and Ryan Childers, 26, live in Somerville, Mass. They got married eight months ago, and both are now working from home due to the coronavirus. \"We've lived together for three years, but I don't think we've ever spent this much time together,\" Safreed says, laughing.</p>", "<p>Childers likes to play in-depth strategy games like <em>Gary Grigsby's War in the Pacific.</em> He says that he's found himself seeking out multiplayer online games that involve more social interaction rather than ones where you play alone.</p>", "<p>\"The games I play are like an hour-long match,\" he says. \"You have enough time to get to know people, you work together as a team. You're getting shot at. You're yelling at each other because you're getting shot at and you don't know where you're getting shot at from. It it gives you enough time to kind of develop good relationships with people and then you move into the next match and you're all on the same team again, so you get the same squad because you know each other and and so on. It's both casual and not.\"</p>", "<p>Safreed's tastes are very different \u2014 she prefers <em>The Sims</em> and <em>Pok\u00e9mon</em>. Her favorite is <em>Animal Crossing</em>, a game for Nintendo Switch.</p>", "<p>\"It's kind of escapism,\" she says. \"Right now things are really scary and I just can't wait to go onto an island and be in debt to a raccoon, and not have coronavirus. I can make my island whatever I want it to be. I can have all my villagers and they're all nice. It's just very idealistic.\"</p>", "<p>The couple regularly plays the board game Dungeons &amp; Dragons with a group of friends. But this week they're going to try playing it online together.</p>", "<p>\"We are a little bit nervous about how that is actually going to work out when we can't kind of keep everyone calm and in control, but I think it will be fun,\" says Safreed. And it's fine if their D&amp;D game doesn't translate perfectly online.</p>", "<p>\"The most important thing,\" she says, is \"we're still talking to each other and checking in on each other after a stressful week.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Meanwhile, the institutions also find themselves needing to pay higher prices for personal protective equipment such as face masks and other gear that's in short supply. Vice President Mike Pence called on hospitals nationwide Wednesday to <a href=\"https://time.com/5805715/mike-pence-hospitals-delay-elective-procedures/\">delay elective surgeries</a> to free up capacity and resources for future coronavirus patients.</p>", "<p>The American Hospital Association responded Thursday by asking Congress for <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2020/03/aha-ama-ana-urge-congress-provide-funding-hospitals-health-systems-nurses-physicians-response-to-covid-19-3-18-2020.pdf\">$100 billion</a> for all hospitals to offset coronavirus costs, citing rural hospitals' inability to withstand huge losses for long.</p>", "<p>\"If we're not able to address the short-term cash needs of rural hospitals, we're going to see hundreds of rural hospitals close before this crisis ends,\" warned Alan Morgan, the head of the <a href=\"https://www.ruralhealthweb.org/\">National Rural Health Association</a>, which represents 21,000 health care providers and hospitals. \"This is not hyperbole.\"</p>", "<p>Well before the COVID-19 threat, rural health care's profitability had collapsed nationwide due to a combination of narrowing Medicare reimbursements, a larger share of patients lacking high-paying private insurance and the hollowing out of rural America. Given such pressures, more than <a href=\"https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/\">120 rural</a> hospitals have been forced to close over the past decade.</p>", "<p>Those hospitals in small-town America that have survived rely heavily on moneymakers such as elective surgeries, physical therapy and lab tests to make their razor-thin margins work. But, according to the Chicago-based Chartis Center for Rural Health, almost half of them still <a href=\"https://www.ivantageindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CCRH_Vulnerability-Research_FiNAL-02.14.20.pdf\">operate in the red</a>.</p>", "<p>So the added financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak could be the final straw for many rural hospitals \u2014 exposing the complicated business dynamics at play within the United States' critical public health infrastructure.</p>", "<p>\"This virus, and what it is causing for these hospitals, is the perfect storm that will close these hospitals at a time this country critically needs them,\" says <a href=\"https://www.millercountyhospital.com/tag/robin-rau/\">Robin Rau</a>, CEO of Miller County Hospital in southwestern Georgia. \"This is going to be the death blow to them.\"</p>", "<p>Two weeks ago, she started eliminating all medical services that were not urgent. She estimates that has cut off at least half of the hospital's revenue. Other CEOs warned similar cuts at their hospitals mean they won't make payroll in the coming weeks.</p>", "<p>The National Rural Health Association, along with many rural hospital executives, is lobbying for immediate cash assistance, no-interest loans, Medicare reimbursement adjustments and other suggestions to alleviate the pain. The association favors a bailout plan from Sens. <a href=\"https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/\">John Barrasso</a>, R-Wyo., and <a href=\"https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/\">Michael Bennet</a>, D-Colo., which in early drafts called for the equivalent of a three-month advance based on hospitals' previous patient numbers, according to Bennet's office.</p>", "<p>\"Rural hospitals have already been closing their doors at startling rates, and this crisis will only exacerbate that fact,\" Bennet tells KHN in a written statement. \"There is an incredible opportunity for rural hospitals to shoulder some of the burdens of caring for patients and helping to meet possible bed shortages.\"</p>", "<p>Still, many rural hospital CEOs worry any assistance may come too late.</p>", "<p>\"And yet I hear they're going to bail out the cruise lines? Really?\" Missouri's Scotland County Hospital CEO Dr. <a href=\"http://www.scotlandcountyhospital.com/about_us/administration.aspx\">Randy Tobler</a> says.</p>", "<p>As Tobler looks at his older, sicker, underinsured patient population, he says he is afraid the hospital, located on the state's northeastern rural border, might last only until May before running out of money for payroll.</p>", "<p>\"In the truly safety-net areas, we're being called to high duty,\" he says. \"And we're running on fumes.\"</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.candlercountyhospital.com/news/news-detail/news/candler-county-hospital-authority-has-welcomed-a-new-ceo/?tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&amp;tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&amp;cHash=1454f73a215f50b47591cd3195f8b9cc\">Michael Purvis</a>, CEO of Candler County Hospital in Metter, Ga., says he's already fallen into a negative cash flow situation in the past week. The number of patients coming to his hospital, which is about 65 miles outside Savannah, for profitable outpatient procedures has dropped by half as people in droves have canceled their surgeries, MRIs and physical therapy. Purvis has implemented fever checks of people at the entrance. But he remains fearful that his billing staff could be forced to quarantine themselves if they fall ill \u2014 effectively shutting off the hospital's revenue.</p>", "<p>\"If my billers and coders stay healthy, I can make it to April, maybe end of June,\" Purvis says.</p>", "<p>On top of the massive loss of revenue, Julie Jones, CEO at <a href=\"http://www.fairfaxmed.com/\">Community Hospital-Fairfax</a> in northwestern Missouri, says she can only get specialty N95 respirator masks that offer critical protection for her front-line providers for about $5 each \u2014 more than 16 times the normal cost of 30 cents.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://clinchmh.org/2018/10/hometown-health-recognizes-clinch-memorial-hospital-ceo-angela-ammons-as-hospital-leader-of-the-year/\">Angela Ammons</a>, CEO of Clinch Memorial Hospital in Homerville, Ga., says she has warned staff that if hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes continue to go missing, she'll watch the video footage and fire on the spot anyone caught stealing supplies. And she is so worried about running out of protective equipment, she's asking any of her \"crafty\" staff with sewing machines to sew cotton masks.</p>", "<p>\"I would rather staff go in with a fabric mask than no mask at all,\" she says.</p>", "<p>To be sure, rural hospitals are not as equipped as larger hospital systems to handle the most serious coronavirus cases. Many are <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/as-coronavirus-spreads-widely-millions-of-older-americans-live-in-counties-with-no-icu-beds/\">not outfitted with ICUs</a> or enough doctors and staff to handle multiple intensive care patients. That means they have to transfer those patients to larger hospitals.</p>", "<p>Still, rural experts argue that their bed and health care capacity can be leveraged to keep potential coronavirus cases out of the major hospitals. Plus, rural facilities could be places for initial triage or eventual recovery care.</p>", "<p>And if nothing changes, Rau worries, the country is about to lose this critical public health infrastructure.</p>", "<p>\"We can talk all we want about the cost of health care in this country in this ridiculous health care system we have,\" she says. \"But at a time like this, who for a minute would think about getting rid of rural hospitals?\"</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://khn.org/\"><em>Kaiser Health News</em></a><em> is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The industry is the country's second-largest private employer with 15.6 million workers. Now,  many of them are without work and face a suddenly shaky job market.</p>", "<p>\"It doesn't matter if you're a big chain or a small corner diner, you're seeing the impact immediately,\" Kennedy says. And it's far from clear when it will end.</p>", "<p>For Rodrigue, it all crashed down with breathtaking speed. Last Sunday, Louisiana officials first raised the idea of a shutdown. Then things accelerated. By Monday, the mandated closure had moved up twice.</p>", "<p>\"For a restaurant, you have to have certainty in order to operate, and those are three changes in one day \u2014 one 24-hour period,\" Rodrigue says. </p>", "<p>Just like that, the economy seized up. Rodrigue is trying to adapt by converting his 115-year-old white-table restaurant into a take-out joint and using up fresh seafood that was supposed to go into iconic Creole specialties like shrimp remoulade and trout amandine.</p>", "<p>But mostly, he's watching his dwindling supply of cash. There's rent to pay and utilities. And he must conserve some money in order to reopen again \u2014 whenever that might be. Rodrigue feels an urgent obligation to carry on, for the sake of his 160 workers, most of whom he had to lay off.</p>", "<p>In between all this, he's counseling waiters and sous-chefs about how to stretch their budgets: \"If you have the choice between buying a box of Hamburger Helper and going to the drive-through somewhere, you need to be as frugal as you possibly can for your own sake and your family's sake.\"</p>", "<p>And so you can see how the cycle keeps repeating onto itself. </p>", "<p>Many restaurant owners are searching for ways to help their staff. Some are trying to sell <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/818797729/how-buying-a-gift-card-can-help-a-small-business\">gift cards</a> and giving proceeds to employees. A new federal law, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818322136/heres-what-is-in-the-families-first-coronavirus-aid-package-trump-approved\">Families First Coronavirus Response Act</a>, passed last week, granting workers at smaller businesses up to two weeks paid leave.</p>", "<p>But the Restaurant Association's Kennedy says that would require restaurants to fund the leave up front at a time when most are already too cash-strapped. Reimbursement from the federal government \u2014 as well as any potential bailouts \u2014 might arrive too late. Most restaurants have enough cash to last a couple days, or maybe a couple weeks.</p>", "<p>\"They simply aren't going to have the financial wherewithal to fund that paid sick leave mandate, Kennedy says. </p>", "<p>The collapse has a massive impact on workers and their families, including Carolyn Stromberg Leasure, who is set to give birth soon in Charlottesville, Va. </p>", "<p>Her chef husband lost his job this past week, which means they have no health insurance. It's a terrifying prospect.</p>", "<p>\"I have a lot of trouble sleeping,\" in large part because of heightened anxiety, she says.

Quarterly records go only as far back as the 1940s, after the Great Depression. </p>", "<p>The first faint signal of what's ahead came Thursday, when the Labor Department reported <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818234501/filings-for-unemployment-benefits-rise-as-coronavirus-hits-job-market\">a sharp jump</a> in first-time claims for unemployment benefits.

Shepherdson expects the U.S. economy to shrink at an annual rate of 10% in the next few months. That's starting to seem optimistic.</p>", "<p>JPMorgan's midrange prediction of a 14% decline is far worse than anything Americans have seen, at least since the 1930s.</p>", "<p>\"This would be the worst single quarter on record,\" said JPMorgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli.  </p>", "<p>Still, Feroli's forecast is relatively upbeat about how long the downturn will last. He expects economic activity to bottom out in April, then recover fairly quickly.</p>", "<p>\"Roughly speaking, it does look like in countries that experienced [the coronavirus] first, it kind of ran its course in about three months,\" Feroli said. \"This is just a sudden freezing up of activity. If that freezing up unfreezes as the virus passes, we should be able to limit the economic damage.\" </p>", "<p>Forecasters are also counting on Congress to act quickly to pass an economic <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818253789/congress-awaits-gop-relief-plan-as-first-lawmakers-test-positive-for-coronavirus\">rescue package</a> valued a $1 trillion or more. </p>", "<p>\"Stimulus spending of this magnitude is not only warranted, but indispensable,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics. The firm predicts a 12% contraction in the second quarter. </p>", "<p>The Trump administration has proposed sending two payments of $1,000 each to most adults, along with two payments of $500 each for children. Senate Republicans have drafted a bill with payments of up to $1,200 per adult. </p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/18/817959179/stimulus-cash-for-strapped-workers-with-few-places-to-spend-it\">Such payments</a> could fill some of the hole left in the economy by the government's aggressive efforts to control the outbreak, while also \"helping kick-start the economy post virus,\" Vanden Houten said.</p>", "<p>JPMorgan looks for unemployment to soar from 3.5% to 6.25% by midyear. Painful as that would be, it's a marked improvement over the Great Recession, when unemployment reached 10%. Other forecasts see unemployment climbing as high as 9%.</p>", "<p>JPMorgan's expectation of a quick economic rebound hinges on two assumptions: The U.S. outbreak doesn't drag on or recur later in the year, and Americans go back to spending quickly once quarantine orders are lifted.</p>", "<p>Feroli acknowledges that neither of those is guaranteed. \"Added on to the uncertainty of the virus is the uncertainty about the psychology that confronts the virus,\" he said.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

The world's crude oil supply is rising even as demand is cratering.</p>", "<p>Some parts of the economy are grappling with pandemic-driven shortages. The oil industry has the opposite problem: so much extra oil that it's not clear where to put it all.</p>", "<p>With millions of people not taking trips, commuting or flying, the world's appetite for oil has come crashing down, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/812054919/the-coronavirus-crisis\">coronavirus</a>. </p>", "<p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/08/813439501/saudi-arabia-stuns-world-with-massive-discount-in-oil-sold-to-asia-europe-and-u-\">a price war</a> between giant producers Saudi Arabia and Russia has caused the oil supply to swing up<em>. </em></p>", "<p>\"I cannot remember having seen such a large potential oversupply situation \u2014 ever,\" says Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, the head of oil markets at Rystad Energy. </p>", "<p>The expected surplus is \"so large as to raise questions about where it can all be stored,\" analysts at Standard Chartered Global Research say.</p>", "<p>President Trump says the U.S. will fill its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, stashing vast quantities of crude in underground salt domes. Tankers at sea can be used as floating storage, but will there be enough of them? Tanks on land are expected to fill up. Some producers may be forced to shut down wells sooner than they planned because no storage facilities will be available for their newly pumped oil. </p>", "<p>Saudi Arabia and Russia are waging a war of attrition, flooding the market with cheap crude in a way that hurts both countries (and every other oil producer). That could mean an increase of more than 2 million barrels per day of oil hitting global markets. </p>", "<p>At the same time, the pandemic could send demand dropping by some 10 million barrels per day during this crisis. </p>", "<p>\"One million barrels per day of change in either demand or production is actually a pretty large number,\" Tonhaugen says. \"And here we are talking about potentially 10 times that.\"</p>", "<p>The situation \u2014 sharp, simultaneous and divergent changes in oil supply and demand \u2014 is remarkable. </p>", "<p>\"We've had supply shocks before,\" says Mike Sommers, the president of the American Petroleum Institute. \"We've had demand shocks before: Think of 9/11 or the Great Recession.\"</p>", "<p>\"We've never had demand shocks <em>with </em>supply shocks,\" he says. \"That's what makes this so unprecedented.\" </p>", "<p>One consequence: lower prices. Oil prices collapsed earlier this month after the Saudi-Russian price war started, and even after a rebound on Wednesday, crude prices are still half what they were a month ago. </p>", "<p>That's a blow to producers, and many American oil and gas companies are expected to go into bankruptcy. </p>", "<p>For consumers, it means <a href=\"https://gasprices.aaa.com/national-gas-price-average-at-cheapest-level-since-2016/\">cheaper gasoline prices</a> \u2014 the national average for regular is down 13 cents per gallon this week to $2.17, AAA says. In 19 states, gas is below $2 per gallon. But with travel restrictions in place and people urged to remain inside their homes, most households won't feel much of a benefit.</p>", "<p>The other side effect of these wild market conditions? This massive surplus of excess oil. </p>", "<p>Analysts say the world can, at least hypothetically, store more than a billion extra barrels of oil. But the world is currently on track for a cumulative surplus of more than 2<em> </em>billion barrels by the end of the year, Standard Chartered analysts say. </p>", "<p>The historic glut will affect oil markets long after quarantines are lifted. And the industry may be reshaped by the coronavirus in other ways, too \u2014 the massive disruption in how we live and work could have unexpected effects on the world's future consumption behavior. </p>", "<p>Will emergency policy interventions support low-carbon energy or reinforce fossil fuel dominance? Will some work continue to be done remotely after the pandemic is over? Will global supply chains resume or economies shift toward local manufacturing? </p>", "<p>\"I do think there's going to be some long-term ramifications.

She doesn't know how she'll be able to pay rent on her apartment in Southern California.</p>", "<p>The federal government took a major step toward helping homeowners this week, ordering lenders to give people hurt financially by the coronavirus pandemic up to a 12-month break <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818343720/homeowners-hurt-financially-by-the-coronavirus-may-get-a-mortgage-break\">on their mortgage payments</a>.</p>", "<p>But what about renters?</p>", "<p>Many cities say they're halting evictions if renters can't pay. But that's about it, says Laurie Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute.</p>", "<p>\"There have been very, very little actions taken for renters,\" Goodman says. \"And in fact, the renter population is far more vulnerable than the homeowner population because, on average, they're just much, much less affluent, and have much less in savings.\"</p>", "<p>Until earlier this week, Angelica Rico had a good job as a digital marketing specialist for a business that helps dental practices promote and run their offices. But then the company put her and most other employees on furlough with no pay \"until this whole thing goes away, which who knows when that will be,\" she says.</p>", "<p>\"Everyone panicked at the time,\" Rico says. \"Obviously, just because work stops and therefore income stops, bills don't stop.\" </p>", "<p>She has a car payment, utilities and student loans. She's investigating how to put the student loan payments on hold since the government <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/20/818977484/education-dept-makes-changes-to-standardized-tests-student-loans-over-coronaviru\">announced a two-month break</a> for people hurt financially by the pandemic. </p>", "<p>But the $1,100 a month she pays as her share of the rent for an apartment in Southern California is by far her biggest expense. \"I can't just pull $1,000 out of a magic hat,\" she says. \"So I am extremely worried about not being able to pay rent.\" </p>", "<p>A few states away in Denver, Alex Vasko's job suffered the same fate on Wednesday. Vasko, who uses the pronoun they, was a banquet captain for a big catering company that does a lot of weddings.</p>", "<p>\"I got a call from my boss and she let us know that corporate came down and said they were ceasing all operations through the end of April,\" they say. As hourly employees, Vasko says, \"me and my co-workers, we're not getting paid.\"</p>", "<p>Vasko tried to apply for unemployment benefits. \"I went online to file a claim online and the system was down,\" they say. In many states, the online systems and unemployment offices have been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/18/817950024/unemployment-websites-are-crashing-across-the-country\">overwhelmed and crashing</a> because so many people have lost work and are applying for help.</p>", "<p>So Vasko isn't sure about the amount of money unemployment will provide, but knows it will be much less than before. </p>", "<p>With the first of the month approaching, many Americans who've suffered a loss of income are going to have to pay their rent or mortgage. For April 1, many could be OK since they still would have a paycheck coming. </p>", "<p>But with no end in sight yet on shutdowns caused by the virus outbreak, Vasko fears not being able to keep paying $1,150 in monthly rent past April. Without some kind of help, Vasko says, \"I have no idea what I would do.\"</p>", "<p>Denver is one of many cities, including Los Angeles, Miami, and San Francisco,  that have <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2020/03/16/growing-number-of-cities-states-halting-evictions-because-of-coronavirus/\">halted evictions of renters</a>. So Vasko says that does \"ease the worry that ... if I can't pay this, I'm going to get kicked out.\"</p>", "<p>But Goodman at the Urban Institute would like to see more help than that for renters. \"It would be the hope that some sort of either rental assistance or per person assistance would become available to allow people to get through this difficult period,\" she said. </p>", "<p>Republicans in the Senate on Thursday introduced legislation that would send cash payments of as much <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818253789/congress-awaits-gop-relief-plan-as-first-lawmakers-test-positive-for-coronavirus\">as $1,200 per person</a> and $2,400 per married couple. </p>", "<p>Vasko said that would be great. But if shutdowns drag on for months, \"unless you're gonna give us $1,000 every month to keep paying rent late, it's not going to do anything in the long run,\" Vasko says.   </p>", "<p>But Harvard economist Ken Rogoff, who studies financial crises, predicts a lot more help will be coming. </p>", "<p>\"There will need to be,\" he  says. He says the $1 trillion offered by the coronavirus stimulus bill taking shape in Washington \"is going to be the first of many trillions.\" </p>", "<p>Rogoff says the government needs to do everything it can to keep people financially healthy and on solid footing. That way when people can leave their homes and life starts getting back to normal they can return to spending money and slingshot the economy into recovery.</p>", "<p>\"The rise in unemployment in 2008 could be dwarfed by this, at least in the short run. This is just something extraordinary,\" Rogoff says. </p>", "<p>And if half the people in the country get their credit scores destroyed and end up in dire financial straits, he says this crisis could be much worse than the last recession.</p>", "<p>So Rogoff says lawmakers should err on the side of throwing too much financial help at people. </p>", "<p>\"When things like this happen, you want to just spend with abandon,\" he says. \"You want to know that you can do whatever it takes to get out of this extraordinary situation, it could turn out to be once-in-a-century situation.

You must take it back, or don't deliver it.' And that's tough, because we've already got it in the system ripening and ready to sell,\" Levin says.</p>", "<p>Can he send those bananas instead to grocery stores that are out of stock? \"Yes, but at a reduced price,\" Levin says.</p>", "<p>The problem, Levin says, is that different customers want slightly different things. Schools and other institutions buy boxes of loose \"petite\" bananas, with 150 bananas in a box. \"Grocery stores don't want those,\" he says.</p>", "<p>At least people are still eating. Drinking is a different story.</p>", "<p>\"We're losing a lot of occasions, regular things like birthday parties or weddings, where people normally get together,\" says <a href=\"https://research.rabobank.com/far/en/authors/stephenr-rannekleiv.html\">Stephen Rannekleiv,</a> who follows the beverage sector for RaboResearch Food &amp; Agribusiness.</p>", "<p>\"For the beverage world, those are occasions for consumption.

That could easily include two dozen or more people. Workers on H-2A visas often live together, sharing kitchens and bedrooms and traveling together on buses. The virus could spread quickly, and measures to stop it will be extremely costly.</p>", "<p>According to Steve Alameda, a vegetable grower in Yuma, Ariz., losing an entire 30-person work crew overnight will be extremely disruptive. Farmworkers already are hard to find, and replacing so many people immediately could prove impossible.</p>", "<p>\"We've got enough disruption,\" Alameda says. \"We don't need to disrupt our food supply, that would be really catastrophic.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Reaching old age is no longer an anomaly, and that is true for people of every race, ethnicity and social class.</p>", "<p>Around 2000, however, came a stark and dramatic reversal of that trend, one documented in the disturbing book <em>Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism</em>, by the husband-and-wife team of Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who won the 2015 Nobel Prize for Economics. For white Americans between 45 and 54, average life expectancy was no longer increasing; in fact, it was actually declining \u2014 in a pattern seen almost nowhere else on Earth. If increases in life expectancy had continued at the same rate, some 600,000 more Americans would now be alive, Case and Deaton write.</p>", "<p>This reversal has come almost entirely among white Americans without a four-year college degree, who make up 38 percent of the U.S. working-age population. \"Something is making life worse, especially for less educated whites,\" Case and Deaton write.</p>", "<p>Much of the decline stems from higher rates of suicide, opioid overdoses and alcohol-related illnesses \u2014 the \"deaths of despair\" that Case and Deaton refer to. Americans \"are drinking themselves to death, or poisoning themselves with drugs, or shooting or hanging themselves.\"</p>", "<p>They're also no longer making progress against heart disease, due to higher rates of obesity and tobacco use. While U.S. smoking rates have declined precipitously over the years, they remain stubbornly high in states such as Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama and Tennessee. Smoking rates are actually rising among middle-aged white women who lack a Bachelor's degree.</p>", "<p>The America that Case and Deaton write about is an intensely class-bound place, where the less-educated experience higher rates of severe mental disease, have more trouble with the \"instrumental activities of daily life,\" such as walking, and report more pain. Chronic pain is now more common among the middle-aged than the elderly, they write.</p>", "<p>By contrast, Americans with a Bachelor's degree live longer, enjoy more stable families, report happier lives and abuse opioids and alcohol less often. They even vote more. Once, suicide was more common among the educated; today, the reverse is true.</p>", "<p>Case and Deaton don't shy away from the likely cause of this public-health scandal: The collapse of the steady, decently paid manufacturing jobs that once gave meaning and purpose to working-class life. They write:</p>", "<p>\"Destroy work and, in the end, working-class life cannot survive. It is the loss of meaning, of dignity, of pride, and of self-respect that comes with the loss of marriage and of community that brings on despair, not just or even primarily the loss of money.\"</p>", "<p>Men without good jobs make lousy husbands and poor fathers. \"They may have children from a series of relationships, some or none of whom they know and some of whom are living with other men. Such fractured and fragile relationships bring little daily joy or comfort and do little to assure middle-aged men that they are living a good life,\" Case and Deaton write.</p>", "<p>In such a world, marriages break up, and social bonds fray. The institutions that once provided ballast to working-class life \u2014 unions and mainstream churches \u2014 have proven largely ineffectual against the tectonic forces now reshaping the global economy.</p>", "<p>Case and Deaton do a great job making the case that something has gone grievously wrong. The solutions they propose, such as repairing the U.S. safety net and overhauling the broken U.S. health-care system, are worthy ones, but somehow don't feel up to addressing the gargantuan social problems they spell out so well.</p>", "<p>Something more will be needed to address the steady erosion of working-class life, with all the heartbreak and despair it's engendered.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

No. But I think given where we are, I think this is a useful set of tools that if used in the right hands could be effective.\"</p>", "<p>Here is a Q&amp;A about the law that Trump has invoked:</p>", "<p><strong>What exactly is the Defense Production Act, or DPA?<br></strong><br>The DPA is a law that has its origins in the <a href=\"https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/exhibitions/artifact/hr-6233-bill-expedite-prosecution-war-effort-first-war-powers-act-december-15\">War</a> Powers <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2014/title-50/appendix-50/second-war-powers-act-1942\">Acts </a>of World War II, which granted the executive branch broad powers to direct industrial production for the war effort. Those authorities were allowed to expire when the war was over, but in 1950, after Soviet-backed North Korea invaded South Korea, President Harry Truman revived those lapsed powers by persuading Congress to enact the DPA.</p>", "<p><strong>But this is not a war \u2014 this is a health crisis. How does the DPA relate to the coronavirus pandemic?<br></strong><br>The law contains a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/4511\">section </a>that authorizes the president to control the production and distribution of scarce materials deemed \"essential to the national defense.\" In his executive order, Trump specifically cites protective equipment (presumably face masks) and ventilators as meeting the criteria in this provision.</p>", "<p><strong>How do the broad authorities in the DPA work for stepping up industrial production?<br></strong><br>The U.S. government is able to make contracts with industry under the law prioritizing the production of goods in scarce supply. It can also provide loan guarantees or lend money directly to targeted industries, and it can <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/defense-production-act-program\">shield them</a> from anti-trust actions resulting from firms cooperating and planning with one another. And if those incentives prove insufficient, administration officials can also <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/4511\">use</a> what's called an \"allocation authority\" \u2014 namely, telling firms that the government has the right to purchase their products above anyone else.</p>", "<p>\"You could use the prospect of these things to get them to agree to what you want to do \u2014 it's a sword of Damocles authority, if you will,\" says Bialos. \"Fundamentally, this is a set of tools the administration can use to negotiate with companies in an industry. So if you're short of some product \u2014 ventilators, face masks, whatever \u2014 you call in the company, survey their capabilities quickly, understand what they can and can't do, and then you start dealing.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Who will be in charge of implementing the DPA to boost output of masks and ventilators?<br></strong><br>In his executive order, Trump delegates his authority to carry out the law \"to the Secretary of Health and Human Services with respect to all health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States.\" HHS Secretary Alex Azar is directed to consult with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the heads of other agencies to determine \"the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of all health and medical resources, including controlling the distribution of such materials\" for responding to the coronavirus crisis.</p>", "<p><strong>What prompted Trump to invoke the DPA?<br></strong><br>Trump did not explain why he waited until now to exercise this authority to invoke the DPA. He had come under increasing fire from Congressional Democrats in recent days for not doing so. One of his critics, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., <a href=\"https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-invoking-the-defense-production-act-a-needed-step-to-ramp-up-domestic-production-of-life-saving-medical-supplies\">reacted favorably</a> to Trump's change of heart. \"Instead of saying we have 'tremendous supplies,' the Trump Administration should start coordinating with the private sector to ensure America actually has the life-saving supplies we need,\" Reed said in a statement. \"Invoking the DPA is a needed step in the right direction.\"</p>", "<p><strong>How quickly might the DPA powers spur increased output of scarce supplies?<br></strong><br>Those powers apply only to U.S. companies, wherever they operate, according to Bialos. He says this could prove problematic if those companies have foreign firms in their supply chain. And not all companies are able to quickly shift production to what the government requires. \"For a company that already makes the widget, it's easier to say, 'OK, let's put your lines to full capacity, let's repurpose your lines,' \" says Bialos. \"It gets a lot harder the less substitutable the production mix is.\"</p>", "<p>Still, Bialos expects the law will make a difference.</p>", "<p>\"I think in the short term, it's a tool to effectively squeeze and mobilize the industrial base,\" he says, \"to get the most out of it.\"</p>", "<p>He also thinks the DPA could prove useful in preparing to face the next crisis. \"We obviously need a stockpile of certain kinds of things for these pandemics that we should put in place and don't have sufficiently set up,\" notes Bialos. \"And you could use this authority to buy things to stockpile so that five, six months from now we're not in the same situation again.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

We don't want all those restaurants to be bustling.\" </p>", "<p>Mankiw, who served in the George W. Bush administration, says the proposed payments should be viewed more as social insurance than a traditional Keynesian stimulus. </p>", "<p>\"The reason for the cash payments is not only to help the people who need the help but also to encourage them to stay at home, which helps everybody else,\" Mankiw said.  </p>", "<p>Bars and restaurants around the country have been closed \u2014 except for take-out \u2014 and many retail shops have also gone dark, as the government encourages Americans to practice <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/17/817251610/its-time-to-get-serious-about-social-distancing-here-s-how\">social distancing</a> in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. </p>", "<p>That's entirely appropriate, said economist Jason Furman, but it will come with a steep price tag. </p>", "<p>\"The public health measures are going to hurt the economy quite a lot in the short run, Furman told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/15/815828788/covid-19-and-the-economy\">Weekend Edition Sunday</a>. \"Our economic policy, though, should be aiming to cushion the blow as much as possible.\"</p>", "<p>Furman, who was a top adviser in the Obama administration, says direct payments to Americans are an important part of an economic recovery package. </p>", "<p>\"For some people, that would enable them not to work,\" Furman said. \"So that's not necessarily for them about increasing economic growth. It's about public health. For others, it would let them continue to pay the rent. And for still others, it would put them in a better position to spend after all of this is over.\"</p>", "<p>The administration's plan would also devote $300 billion to loan guarantees for small businesses, so this temporary disruption doesn't cascade into a permanent shutdown. </p>", "<p>\"There are a lot of businesses that are going to struggle here that we want to survive in the long run,\" Mankiw said. \"So we really need to help the businesses through this time. That doesn't mean a bailout. It doesn't mean handing them cash. But it does perhaps mean providing them with loans so they can keep operating and get back on their feet when this is over.\"</p>", "<p>The proposed loan guarantees would go to small businesses that agree to keep paying workers for eight weeks. Coronavirus closings have already triggered <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/18/816666688/you-don-t-expect-it-to-happen-to-you-when-your-job-is-suddenly-gone\">a wave of layoffs</a>.

Mankiw said that's worthwhile, even though it would add to the mounting federal debt. </p>", "<p>\"In many cases, I am a deficit scold, but not in this circumstance,\" he said. \"There are certain times that are crises \u2014 deep economic downturns, wars --when running a budget deficit and running up the government debt is exactly the right thing to do.

Depending on their situation, they should be eligible to have their mortgage payments reduced or suspended for up to 12 months.</p>", "<p>Federal regulators, through the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are ordering lenders <a href=\"http://www.freddiemac.com/about/covid-19.html\">to offer</a> homeowners <a href=\"https://www.fanniemae.com/portal/media/corporate-news/2020/covid-homeowner-assistance-options-7000.html\">flexibility</a>. The move covers about half of all home loans in the U.S. \u2014 those guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. But regulators expect that the entire mortgage industry will quickly adopt a similar policy.</p>", "<p>Under the plan, people who have suffered a loss of income can qualify to make reduced payments or be granted a complete pause in payments.</p>", "<p>\"That forbearance is up to 12 months, depending on their particular situation,\" says Mark Calabria, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie.</p>", "<p>Homeowners can't just stop paying their mortgage. \"They need to contact their servicer \u2014 that is the lender that they send the check to every month,\" he says. \"That lender will work with them to be able to work out a payment plan. Obviously, we hope to get them back on their feet as soon as possible.\"</p>", "<p>Calabria says people in financial distress because of the coronavirus can just verbally testify to that over the phone with their lender. Documenting the hardship can come later. \"You're not going to have to send 20 pieces of paper at the front of this,\" he says. \"We want to do it quickly.\"</p>", "<p>This is not a forgiveness of debt or free money. Homeowners will work out a repayment plan once they recover financially. Calabria says that this might involve just extending the term of the loan.</p>", "<p>\"I think this is a great first step,\" says Chris Mayer, a real estate economist at Columbia University's business school. He says the move is \"critically important at this point so we just don't have mass panic.\"</p>", "<p>There's enough stress and uncertainty about the virus that people shouldn't need to worry about losing their homes, he says.</p>", "<p>Fannie and Freddie are directing lenders not to report people to the credit bureaus for late or missed payments if they are in one of these forbearance plans. Mayer says that's a key element of the plan.</p>", "<p>\"We don't want people who have been responsible in making their mortgage payments to suddenly be declared delinquent and to lose their access to credit,\" he says. That's really important for the economy to recover as quickly as possible after the outbreak is over. \"Let's fight the virus, and let's hold people harmless for something that they didn't control,\" Mayer says.</p>", "<p>But homeowners can't just stop making payments \u2014 that will badly damage their credit.</p>", "<p>\"Don't just miss payments and ignore the problem,\" Mayer says. \"You need to reach out to your servicer. Tell them that you're having problems associated with coronavirus or your job and ask them to be put into a forbearance program.\"</p>", "<p>Two of the nation's largest home lenders, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, say they're working to help borrowers who've been hurt financially by the outbreak.</p>", "<p>For all this to work right, lenders will have to follow through and do what the government is directing them to do.</p>", "<p>Fannie and Freddie are also telling lenders to halt foreclosures, though this is more of a public health move because anyone facing foreclosure already would have run into serious financial trouble before the coronavirus started to spread in the United States.</p>", "<p>These moves don't do anything to help renters. Many municipalities are halting evictions for people who can't pay rent. And housing advocates hope the federal government comes up with a program soon to offer financial assistance to renters who in most cases have fewer financial resources than homeowners.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Only around 15,000 people have been tested so far, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And public health experts say that's not nearly enough to know how widespread the outbreak is and how to respond.</p>", "<p>But the Food and Drug Administration has just approved a new test from the giant pharmaceutical company Roche that could represent a major breakthrough.</p>", "<p>The initial test approved by the FDA is complex and requires specialized training and equipment. Until this week, some of the supplies required to do the test had to come from a single company in Germany that couldn't meet the demand.</p>", "<p>\"The big players that normally sell things like the [regular flu] test kits or rapid strep test kits to hospitals, they haven't had assays authorized yet by FDA,\" says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories.</p>", "<p>So in other words, the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. and the world haven't been able to pitch in and help.</p>", "<p>But that just changed in a very big way.</p>", "<p>\"We're very excited to share the news that overnight we got emergency use authorization from the FDA,\" says Paul Brown, a senior executive for Roche. He says the company has a new test that's more simple, and quicker to get results.</p>", "<p>Roche has already begun production while it awaited FDA approval, he says.</p>", "<p>\"We have about 400,000 tests that are available for the U.S. market,\" Brown says. And he says Roche expects to manufacture about 1.5 million tests per month.</p>", "<p>That's a lot more tests than have been administered so far.</p>", "<p>And Brown says there are about 100 Roche machines already in use across the country, each capable of processing more than of 1,000 tests per day.</p>", "<p>Michael Mina, an associate medical director of virology at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston, says that if that kind of manufacturing pace can be kept up, \"I think that will be one of the pieces that turns out to be sort of a game changer in the testing capacity in the United States.\"</p>", "<p>Mina and other public health experts say that dramatically ramping up testing is crucial to saving lives.</p>", "<p>Marc Lipsitch, who directs the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard's School of Public Health, says testing is needed at emergency rooms in every major metro area across the country. That would offer statistically significant sampling to get reliable estimates on how many Americans actually have the coronavirus, he says.</p>", "<p>\"I think we're flying almost completely blind right now,\" Lipsitch says. \"We have a lot of uncertainty about whether we have 10 times more or 100 times more cases than we know about.\"</p>", "<p>Other countries appear to have been doing a better job with testing. South Korea, <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-many-coronavirus-tests-per-capita-have-been-completed\">by one recent count</a>, had been testing 700 times as many people per capita as the U.S.</p>", "<p>Mina says it's striking just how unprepared the U.S. has turned out to be to face an outbreak like this. He thinks much will be learned from it. But with so much at stake, he says, \"I just wish that we had really begun to take this problem seriously as a country two months ago versus really focusing on it just within the last couple of weeks.\"</p>", "<p>Roche says it will start shipping those first 400,000 test kits this weekend.

TSA requested that $21 million earmarked for that be cut from its budget, which Congress approved last year. </p>", "<p>Shuker says his airport in Philadelphia is one that saw its cleaning reimbursements cut, but there wasn't much communication about that except, \"We didn't have the money to pay cleaners to come up and clean.\"</p>", "<p>According to an industry executive speaking on background, some of the nation's largest airports' cleaning reimbursements were reduced due to the budget cut. Whether that means checkpoints aren't getting cleaned is unclear. Miami International Airport spokesman Greg Chin said in a statement that there's been no interruption in cleaning there, but TSA is no longer providing funding to cover its costs. </p>", "<p>TSA declined an interview request, and did not respond to written questions.

Millions of people are trying to work from home \u2014 if they can, of course. <em>Life Kit </em>wants to help WFH work for you, especially if you're doing so for the first time.</p>", "<p><em>We've also got episodes on </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/27/810016611/coronavirus-101-what-you-need-to-know-to-prepare-and-prevent\"><em>health precautions you can take</em></a><em> (like washing your hands!) and one about </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/814615866/coronavirus-and-parenting-what-you-need-to-know-now\"><em>keeping kids entertained and active during all the school closures</em></a><em>. </em></p>", "<p>Here are some pro-tips for working remotely, possibly for an extended period of time.</p>", "<p><strong>1. Get your technology in order.</strong></p>", "<p>Technology is what enables remote work in the first place.</p>", "<p>So make sure to take your laptop home, and don't forget your charger. Also, take home your mouse and keyboard \u2014 anything that might make working on your laptop from home a little easier.</p>", "<p>If you don't have a work laptop and you'll be spending a long time remote, ask if your supervisor wants you to take your desktop computer home. If you don't drive and it's too much to carry on public transport, ask your employer if you can expense a taxi or rideshare.</p>", "<p>Then there's the software. Make sure you have the right applications. Lots of remote workers are leaning heavily on Slack, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Zoom or GoToMeeting. Iron out what your team is planning to use ASAP.</p>", "<p>Of course, you'll want to make sure all your technology actually works from home. Do you need a secure line? Are those applications accessible from your home Wi-Fi? Do you need a security key to log in? These are all questions to ask your supervisor or IT department.</p>", "<p><strong>Listen to <em>Life Kit</em></strong></p>", "<p>This story comes from <em>Life Kit, </em>NPR's podcast with tools to help you get it together. Listen to the podcast episode at the top of the page, or <a href=\"https://apple.co/2x20KPu\">find it here</a>.</p>", "<p><strong>2. Make sure you have bandwidth. </strong></p>", "<p>Another thing? Internet access \u2014 is yours robust enough at home to allow you to video conference? Many conferences and almost all nonessential work travel are being canceled right now, so people want to use online video conferencing, which requires a good Internet connection.</p>", "<p>If your bandwidth is low and you're on a video call, try shutting down other programs to lighten the load on your connection. If your connection is really choppy, you can often shut off the video portion of a call and participate with audio only, which defeats the purpose of seeing your team but will still allow you to participate in the conversation.</p>", "<p>Another Internet hog? Kids.</p>", "<p>If your connection is not robust, set some ground rules about when kids can't be online because mom is on a conference call, or stagger your video meetings with your partner or other family members if possible.</p>", "<p><strong>3. The kids are alright \u2014 but they're home too. </strong></p>", "<p>With school closures and concerns about putting kids in day care, as well as staffing those places up, parents are faced with a challenge, especially parents who have to physically go to work because they have no remote work option.</p>", "<p>If you are working from home with kids in tow, you'll need to make a plan for education and entertainment. Stock up on books and puzzles. Also, it's OK to use streaming services (Common Sense Media has <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/what-to-watch-read-and-play-while-your-kids-are-stuck-indoors\">good recommendations</a> for kid-appropriate content).</p>", "<p>One note on play dates, though, since school closures are designed to limit contact among kids. Our <em>Life Kit</em> parenting hosts, Anya Kamenetz and Cory Turner, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/814615866/coronavirus-and-parenting-what-you-need-to-know-now\">reported on managing parenting in the time of coronavirus</a>, and cite this advice from Maria Litvinova, a scholar who has published several papers on school closures in epidemics: </p>", "<p>\"If the school is closed for a certain amount of time, even if it's long and difficult for parents to organize the care, it's important that they do not regroup children again because the effect of the school closure will be much less.\" </p>", "<p>Families across the country are getting very creative with virtual play dates using video chat as well as platforms like <a href=\"https://corp.roblox.com/technology/\">Roblox</a>, which allows kids to chat while playing a video game together.  </p>", "<p>Also, be flexible about how much work you might realistically be able to get done if you're balancing child care. #WorkLifeBalance. Just not the kind you were hoping for.</p>", "<p><em>Here are </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/814615866/coronavirus-and-parenting-what-you-need-to-know-now\"><em>more tips on managing parenting in the time of coronavirus</em></a><em>, including ideas for working from home with little ones. </em></p>", "<p><strong>4.</strong><em> </em><strong>Manage expectations. </strong></p>", "<p>It's wise to have a discussion with your boss about what can actually be accomplished from home.</p>", "<p>Ask your manager what the priorities are, and discuss how tasks will get done.</p>", "<p>How are teams going to track projects they're working on? How will they meet to discuss this? Will you all be connecting on Slack or email? Will there be standing meetings at a certain time to get everyone coordinated?</p>", "<p>This should be an ongoing conversation. Remember, going fully remote is a new experience for many companies and their workers. Be honest about what isn't working or can't get done in these circumstances. More overall communication is going to be necessary.</p>", "<p><strong>5. Know thyself (and thy WFH weaknesses). </strong></p>", "<p>If you're distractible, get ready for work every morning like you are going to physically go into work. Dress up, do your hair \u2014 whatever you'd normally do. This puts you in a professional mindset.</p>", "<p>It's hard to draw a sharp distinction between home and office when you're <em>at</em> home. But to the extent possible, create a space at home that looks and feels like your office to you.</p>", "<p>If you're the type of person who never takes a break at home, set a timer to take time for lunch, and turn off your work. Or go for a walk. If you don't change your venue at some point during the day and take a breather, it can make the claustrophobia worse. Try to maintain normal work hours, and shut things down when you would normally leave the office.</p>", "<p>Try to appreciate the benefits that do come with remote work. You're not commuting. You're able to make your own lunch and save money doing so. You have more control over your schedule and more time with family. Focus on whatever positives you can find.</p>", "<p><strong>6. Embrace the webcam.</strong></p>", "<p>Conference calls are tough \u2014 there are time delays, not knowing who's talking because you can't see the person, people getting interrupted on accident.</p>", "<p>Webcams can solve a number of these issues: the sense of isolation and that confusion.</p>", "<p>\"To be able to see the person you're talking to I think is important,\" says Matthew Hollingsworth, who heads operations at Tiny Boards, a company that has several job boards for remote work.</p>", "<p>And also, he says, because we miss cues when we aren't working together in person, make doubly sure all colleagues understand their marching orders.</p>", "<p>\"I tend to overcommunicate, and I think that's a good default setting,\" he says. Don't be afraid to ask, \"Is this clear?\"</p>", "<p>You can even try repeating back what you heard the other person say, to make sure you interpreted the person's meaning correctly.</p>", "<p><strong>7. Stay connected. </strong></p>", "<p>One undeniable loss is the social, casual \"water cooler\" conversation that connects us to people \u2014 if you're not used to that loss, full-time remote work can feel isolating.</p>", "<p>To fill the gap, some co-workers are scheduling online social time to have conversations with no agenda. Use Slack chats and things like that if you miss real-time interaction.</p>", "<p>Again, embrace video calling and webcams so you can see your colleagues. Try an icebreaker over your team chat: What's everyone's favorite TV show right now? What's one good thing that someone read that day?</p>", "<p><strong>8. Do what you can; discuss when you can't. </strong></p>", "<p>Before the spread of the coronavirus, roughly half of American workers were doing at least some telework.</p>", "<p>But about a third of American workers cannot work remotely \u2014 fast-food and factory workers, people who are stocking the shelves in grocery stores and warehouses, nurses and doctors on the front lines of health care. They can't work from home.</p>", "<p>If you really can't work remotely, ask your employer what you can do to make sure you're not losing pay. That said, this is a shifting landscape. It's not clear that hourly workers or workers who can't do remote work will be paid if they can't work.</p>", "<p>The lack of paid leave or sick leave is certainly in the spotlight because of this virus. Some companies, including McDonald's, Walmart and <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-to-give-up-to-two-weeks-of-pay-to-employees-out-sick-with-coronavirus-or-in-quarantine/\">Amazon are now saying they will offer paid leave or sick leave</a> to protect the health of customers as well as their workers.</p>", "<p>Airlines are paying flight attendants who signed up for shifts and are quarantined, for example. And some unions are trying to negotiate the issue of missed pay.</p>", "<p>So the best thing is to ask your manager or human resources department.

Companies already were cutting costs and now will have to cut deeper as oil prices remain low.</p>", "<p>Oil prices bounced back a bit after President Trump said the Department of Energy would buy crude for the nation's strategic petroleum reserve. </p>", "<p>\"We're going to fill it right to the top,\" Trump said Friday in a wide-ranging news conference at the White House.  He said it will save taxpayers \"billions and billions of dollars\" while helping an industry that's been reeling.  </p>", "<p>While oil prices increased nearly 5% after Friday's announcement, that was just a fraction of the amount they lost earlier in the week. </p>", "<p>In South Texas, Rudy Martinez immediately experienced the effects of the past week's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/08/813439501/saudi-arabia-stuns-world-with-massive-discount-in-oil-sold-to-asia-europe-and-u-\">collapse in crude oil prices</a>. </p>", "<p>\"I actually have a little man camp and these guys are on the way out because they lost contracts,\" says Martinez, who has eight rooms he rents to out-of-town oilfield workers in Karnes City, Texas. </p>", "<p>\"The workers get their per-diem and I charge them $100 a person [per week]. Actually I'd like to charge them a little more than that, but now that it's tapered off, it's hard to charge them that because they can't pay it,\" he says. </p>", "<p>Back when the oil business was really booming in Karnes City, Martinez says he could charge up to $2000 a week per person. </p>", "<p>This is one small example of what declining oil prices mean for the rural communities that depend on the oil business. And there's a lot at stake for the U.S., the world's largest producer of crude oil. </p>", "<p>Oil prices had been falling out of fears the coronavirus epidemic threatened world economic growth.  Demand was also down as large gatherings were canceled and people started staying home to avoid getting sick. </p>", "<p>Then prices plunged after <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/08/813439501/saudi-arabia-stuns-world-with-massive-discount-in-oil-sold-to-asia-europe-and-u-\">Saudi Arabia and Russia</a> failed to agree on production cuts and instead entered a price war last Sunday.  In a stunning reversal, Saudi Arabia said it would actually boost oil production and offer a massive discount for its customers.  </p>", "<p>U.S. oil companies, especially smaller ones, are now looking to make deep cuts. Industry analysts warn of possible bankruptcies, especially if oil remains where it's fallen to, in the $30 per barrel range. Companies operating in Texas's Eagle Ford Shale need prices between $40 to $60 a barrel to remain profitable.</p>", "<p><strong>'We were here before the oil'</strong></p>", "<p>Karnes City was transformed by the oil drilling boom that started about a decade back.

Ruckman says it takes time for drillers to wind down production plans that already were being implemented when prices collapsed. </p>", "<p>\"Probably, in a few weeks to a month or two, I think you're going to see things slow down. But we'll still be here \u2014 we were here before the oil,\" says Ruckman, who tries to stay optimistic about the financial future of his community.</p>", "<p>There <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/trump-oil-bailout/\">have been reports</a> the Trump administration may be willing to help the oil industry in other ways. For example, the White House could reduce federal royalties for oil pumped on government land or offshore.  The administration could also offer low-interest government-backed loans. </p>", "<p>Groups focused on climate change have criticized such ideas. </p>", "<p>\"The last people who deserve taxpayers' money are the billionaires that created and profited from the climate crisis,\" says Jack Shapiro of the environmental group Greenpeace. </p>", "<p>One potential bright spot in all this is gasoline <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815226243/the-return-of-2-gasoline-pandemic-and-geopolitics-send-prices-down\">prices</a>.

As Austan Goolsbee told us in the episode, \"The thing about virus economics that's different from regular business-cycle economics is the most important thing you can do for the economy has nothing to do with the economy.\"</p>", "<p>Paid leave would keep way more people isolated, which is exactly what public health officials are recommending right now.

You can </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money\">sign up here</a>. </p>", "<p>It's been a crazy couple of days, and we showed up at the office Monday morning with as many questions as anyone. And we've been reading as fast as we can to try and figure out how to understand a spreading pandemic, a spiraling oil market, warnings of a coming recession, and the largest drop in the S&amp;P 500 since the 2008 financial crisis. So here's a few of the best answers we found from around the econ universe. </p>", "<p><strong>What Does the Coronavirus Mean for the Global Economy?</strong></p>", "<p>We've been talking a lot in the office about supply and demand shocks, which is econospeak for forces that knock economies off their trajectories. And we're starting to see them firsthand. A trendy noodle shop opened up across the street last summer. We haven't been able to get in because of the lines. On Friday, the city was pretty empty, and so was the noodle shop: That's a classic demand shock. We took advantage and got our noodles in five minutes. Monday we returned for more of the same. There weren't that many customers, but it took 30 minutes to get our noodles. Why? Half the kitchen staff stayed home. \"People are paranoid,\" said the guy at the register. When an economy can't make goods because of a labor shortage, that's a supply shock. The noodle shop is getting shocked both ways, and so, maybe, is the economy. </p>", "<p>The most authoritative discussion we found of this is <a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=62385196efb9fb163d6002dc107b1b2278ab23c7b8f4735b06960914f6d1d33710a4df1c7429c812c1db33d99cbcf0b3b335dd3abb21f331\">a new piece</a> from Gita Gopinath, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. She lists potential economic policies for governments to help deal with these shocks right now.  </p>", "<p><strong>How Bad Is the Coronavirus?</strong> </p>", "<p>One of the most helpful things that came across our feed recently is Justin Fox's piece for <em>Bloomberg View</em>, \"<a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=62385196efb9fb168ff9f1e8dae955024fbda895456043b9a68cfa0f896d128a992fc40d0e18d49e7356374059d664d6b4eab31213aa83e1\">How Bad is the Coronavirus? Let's Run the Numbers</a>.\" As he puts it, \"The coronavirus outbreak has been turning a lot of us into amateur epidemiologists.\" Though it's an opinion piece, it doesn't have a take. It just has numbers. </p>", "<p>And as budding amateur epidemiologists ourselves, we read carefully about the medical term \"R,\" which denotes the infection rate. Fox writes, \"Could Covid-19 really spread as widely as the flu? If allowed to, sure. The standard metric for infectiousness is what's called the reproduction number, or R0. It is usually pronounced 'R naught,' and the zero after the R should be rendered in subscript, but it's a simple enough concept. An R0 of one means each person with the disease can be expected to infect one more person. If the number dips below one, the disease will peter out. If it gets much above one, the disease can spread rapidly.\" Right now, Fox says, the R0 of the COVID-19 coronavirus is 2.8, meaning it is on average spreading from one person to 2.8 people. But it is below one in communities like Wuhan, China, where it started. We think we're going to be hearing more about \"R-naught,\" and we're hoping it goes below one.  </p>", "<p><strong>How Should We Think About the Market?</strong></p>", "<p>We don't do buys and sells and pops and drops and all that market-watching, but sometimes you can't look away. These last couple of days have been those kinds of days. Things got so disheveled today we actually turned on the television. But we learned more from the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>'s Andy Kessler, who was an investor before he was a writer, and he does a nice job <a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=62385196efb9fb16ee5af6b1ff105d85e7a89dbd8e52be307c88db4ce3412161e26f6f4316a66da4e8ede8ed7fb2d3259efe621e5b1f9586\">explaining</a> how he (and the market) thinks about and prices risk. He argues that the risk is essentially a timeline projected into the future, and the pricing of the market reflects how long we think things are going to be uncertain. It's why as the COVID-19 coronavirus looks to be sticking around for longer, the markets are reacting more strongly.  </p>", "<p><strong>Saudi Arabia Did What?</strong> </p>", "<p>Oil prices plunged on Monday as Saudi Arabia declared it would increase production even though prices were falling. This basically never happens. Julian Lee, an oil strategist for <em>Bloomberg First Word</em>, <a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=62385196efb9fb16a0e8252abb896eace1037cea5eca6423cf204e981df6d4f0680af47a597d43055f28a0f04a7a35511d6af3615f8c6758\">looks at </a>what the heck is going on with the oil market. Global oil prices are influenced by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and Saudi Arabia, an important member, appears to be mad at Russia, which is not in OPEC but is in a less tightly knit group known as \"OPEC Plus.\" Lee says Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aims to drive oil prices down \"so far and so fast that Russia realizes it made a terrible mistake in refusing to agree to deepen output cuts at Friday's OPEC gathering.\" </p>", "<p>We'll let you know as we learn more.

They didn't want to wreck a great vacation if the odds were really small that there'd actually be a problem on their cruise. </p>", "<p>\"Are you being a bad parent because you're you're buying into panic or hysteria?\" Nalbandian says. \"Or are you being a bad parent because you're bringing them to a situation that maybe in retrospect could be like, what was I thinking?\"</p>", "<p>But now many cruise ship companies are trying to reassure customers that they don't need to panic and cancel now. Customers can wait and see what happens with the outbreak and can even cancel just a few days before their cruise and get credit for another trip later.</p>", "<p>Nalbandian got an email from Norwegian Cruise Line this past weekend explaining she can cancel up to 48 hours before her trip and get a full refund in the form of a credit toward a future trip. </p>", "<p>\"It was a relief ,\" she says, \"and it definitely left us with a warm and fuzzy feeling toward the cruise line.\"  </p>", "<p>\n                Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said elderly people and people with underlying health problems should take special precautions and not  travel on cruise ships.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Patrick Semansky/AP\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said elderly people and people with underlying health problems should take special precautions and not  travel on cruise ships.</p>", "<p>She says their plan now is to wait until a couple of weeks before the cruise and decide then.

In order to curb the spread of COVID-19, many countries have implemented strict screening procedures that have denied port entry rights to ships and prevented passengers from disembarking. In some cases, local authorities have permitted disembarkation but subjected passengers to local quarantine procedures. While the U.S. government has evacuated some cruise ship passengers in recent weeks, repatriation flights should not be relied upon as an option for U.S. citizens under the potential risk of quarantine by local authorities.\"  </p>", "<p>Stewart Chiron, who has worked in the cruising travel industry for 30 years, says he was \"very shocked and disappointed\" by the government's warning. </p>", "<p>\"It's too far extreme,\" says Chiron, who books cruises for people through his cruiseguy.com website. </p>", "<p>He says to warn elderly people and those with medical conditions seems reasonable.

Others are canceling, or trying to.</p>", "<p>Ashley Manning, a nurse practitioner in Knoxville, Tenn., decided to cancel her cruise coming up in nine days to the Mexican Riviera on Carnival Cruise Line. \"I've called Delta, I've canceled our flights,\" she says. \"They were nonrefundable tickets.

Did the reporting hold up?</p>", "<p>The intriguing tale began in mid-September with an invitation for two <em>New York Times </em>reporters to come to the Midtown Manhattan offices of the legendary lawyer David Boies for an off-the-record session.</p>", "<p>The two reporters \u2014 Jake Bernstein and Emily Steel \u2014 were asked to leave their phones and laptops outside the conference room. No taping.</p>", "<p>The guest of honor: a hard-drinking, burly man who promised that he could link powerful politicians and globe-trotting luminaries to the late Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and sexual predator. Boies and another lawyer for Epstein accusers introduced the reporters to the apparent informant.</p>", "<p>The man went by a pseudonym, Patrick Kessler, saying he feared retribution. He boasted about damning videos of prominent men at Epstein's properties. And Kessler showed the reporters, as he had the lawyers, blurry stills of what he said were men having sex with women and girls.</p>", "<p>He claimed the men were in the top echelons of politics, finance and law. He promised proof.</p>", "<p>But the informant appears to have been a fraud. And he has since vanished. Even so, he inspired an investigation by the <em>Times </em>not of Epstein, but of one of the country's most famous lawyers. In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/30/business/david-boies-pottinger-jeffrey-epstein-videos.html\">a 5,400-word expose</a> published on Nov. 30 and an hourlong <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/the-weekly/jeffrey-epstein-secret-videos.html\">television show</a>, the <em>Times </em>placed Boies at the center of a narrative that insinuates deceit and greed inside a morally corrupt legal system.</p>", "<p>The story, the result of months of reporting by a team of four <em>Times</em> journalists, promised to reveal how even the lawyers representing alleged victims of sexual predators seek paydays in ways that enable powerful men to avoid accountability.</p>", "<p>Boies says the <em>Times</em> account is terribly unfair. \"I didn't do anything deceitful here, and there's no basis for that allegation,\" Boies tells NPR in December. \"For them to put that in the article that is about me, without making clear that they're not making that allegation about me, it is, I think, quite misleading.\"</p>", "<p>To this day, it remains unclear what the newspaper's reporting uncovered.</p>", "<p>Boies' own actions on other matters had already tarnished his reputation. But the <em>Times</em> journalists acknowledge they didn't have evidence that proved Boies either acted wrongfully or intended to profit from the Epstein cases. And their chief informant for the story had lied repeatedly, the <em>Times</em> itself concluded.</p>", "<p>* * *</p>", "<p>Epstein was arrested last July on sex trafficking charges. A month later, he was found dead in his jail cell in what has been ruled a suicide.</p>", "<p>In August, the man calling himself Patrick Kessler approached <em>The</em> <em>Winchester Star</em> in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley with the same story about Epstein's powerful friends. As captured on an audio recording, one of the Winchester reporters asked Kessler why he didn't seek out a national news outlet. Kessler said he trusted the <em>Star </em>because he had grown up nearby.</p>", "<p>Reporters there soon questioned his veracity. The <em>Star</em> spoke to a lawyer whom Kessler claimed to have consulted. He said he <a href=\"https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/man-who-tried-to-con-lawyers-representing-jeffrey-epstein-s/article_cd18b504-d0dd-5468-85b9-6151a40247ab.html\">hadn't heard of Kessler</a>.</p>", "<p><em>\"</em>When he did not show up a week later, I thought, 'Well, this guy's a crackpot or, you know, a fabulist,' somebody who just likes to spin stories and just wasted our time,\" says <em>Winchester Star </em>reporter Evan Goodenow. \"And so I kind of dismissed it<em>.\"</em></p>", "<p>Just a week after that, the two <em>Times </em>reporters met Kessler at Boies' office.</p>", "<p>Not even an hour after the meeting, Kessler sent a text message to <em>Times </em>reporter Emily Steel saying that he wanted to meet again. That afternoon, at the back of a Chinese restaurant, Kessler steered the two <em>Times </em>reporters, Steel and Bernstein, toward what he argued was a different scandal: the behavior of the two lawyers they had just met. Kessler alleged the attorneys wanted to turn his material to their own advantage, rather than that of their clients \u2014 the women who said they had been victimized by Epstein and his social circle.</p>", "<p>This new direction appealed to the <em>Times</em>. Investigative reporter and one of the four journalists on the story Jessica Silver-Greenberg tells NPR that she had been seeking a window into \"the universe of people, powerful men, that had potentially enabled Epstein and allowed him to continue to allegedly abuse women for decades.\"</p>", "<p>Lawyers had helped to shield Epstein, Silver-Greenberg says, creating a financial model in which they could secure big payouts for accusers and fees for themselves from the prominent men their clients accused \u2014 but let those men keep their actions secret.</p>", "<p>It reminded her of nondisclosure agreements in settlements of harassment claims against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Women were paid but had to keep silent, keeping the pattern of his behavior from public view. Lawyers struck similar deals for accusations against the late Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly, now both gone from Fox News. (Ailes, Weinstein and O'Reilly all denied those allegations.) The <em>Times </em>reported extensively on them all, helping to usher in the #MeToo movement.</p>", "<p>Nondisclosure pacts are legal and even common in corporate life. Some attorneys for alleged victims say clients seek to avoid public glare. Yet NDAs are increasingly under attack. Most recently, now-former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg announced he would release three women who filed complaints against him at Bloomberg LP from confidentiality clauses after rivals blasted him for it at a Democratic presidential debate.</p>", "<p>\"I had been looking at all this huge network of lawyers,\" Silver-Greenberg tells NPR, \"not only in the defense attorneys who were representing Epstein, but also the attorneys that had represented the victims.\"</p>", "<p>Boies stood out. He was a towering figure with an illustrious record as a litigator. He had argued the government's antitrust case against Microsoft a generation ago. He was Al Gore's go-to attorney in the 2000 election recount debacle. Boies helped persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to legalize gay marriage.</p>", "<p>Boies also caught their attention because he represented the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, accused of sexual assault or harassment by 100 women. Weinstein was convicted last month of felony sex crime and rape and sentenced Wednesday to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/11/814051801/harvey-weinstein-sentenced-to-23-years-in-prison\">23 years in prison</a>.</p>", "<p>In Epstein's case, Boies Schiller represents several women with claims against the financier's estate and friends.</p>", "<p>In that first meeting with the <em>Times</em> reporters, a second lawyer was present, by the name of Stan Pottinger. Pottinger would play an essential role in the <em>Times</em>' tale. He and Boies are friends; their unrelated firms represent different clients with similar accusations against Epstein and his associates. (Pottinger did not return four messages from NPR seeking comment.) Though he is not nearly as prominent as Boies, Pottinger was a Justice Department official under President Ford and dated Gloria Steinem in the 1970s and 1980s. He is now at Edwards Pottinger.</p>", "<p>Kessler promised the reporters a window into how the lawyers operated.</p>", "<p>Kessler shared with the <em>Times </em>texts that Pottinger had sent in which he had drawn up a \"hot list\" of prominent men as possible targets. Boies was not copied on the exchanges.</p>", "<p>The <em>Times</em> wrote, \"It seemed [to Kessler] like Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger were plotting to use his footage to demand huge sums from billionaires. He said it looked like blackmail.\"</p>", "<p>Pottinger suggested in his texts that lawyers could make up to 40% of the money they negotiated in private settlements. Pottinger confirmed the texts were authentic, the paper reported. Pottinger said he had been deceiving Kessler to get him to share what videos and other documentation he had against Epstein's friends. Pottinger also told the paper he informed the FBI and a federal prosecutor about the material Kessler claimed to have.</p>", "<p>Emails between Boies and <em>Times</em> reporters show him wrestling over whether to trust Kessler, hoping but not certain the informant was real.</p>", "<p>The <em>Times</em> concluded that Boies had outsourced his relationship with Kessler to Pottinger and that the lawyers were working in concert. The <em>Times </em>used Kessler's communications with Pottinger to convey a story of hypocrisy and greed about Boies as well.</p>", "<p>* * *</p>", "<p>Here's the defining passage of<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/30/business/david-boies-pottinger-jeffrey-epstein-videos.html\"> the article</a>:</p>", "<p><em>\"Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger would go from toasting Kessler as their 'whistle-blower' and 'informant' to torching him as a 'fraudster' and a 'spy.'</em></p>", "<p><em>\"Kessler was a liar, and he wouldn't expose any sexual abuse. </em></p>", "<p><em>\"But he would reveal something else: The extraordinary, at times deceitful measures elite lawyers deployed in an effort to get evidence that could be used to win lucrative settlements \u2014 and keep misconduct hidden, allowing perpetrators to abuse again.</em></p>", "<p><em>\"Mr. Boies has publicly decried such deals as 'rich man's justice,' a way that powerful men buy their way out of legal and reputational jeopardy. This is how it works.\"</em></p>", "<p>David Enrich, a <em>Times </em>business editor who helped to report the story, tells NPR, \"Our obligation is to be truthful and as transparent as possible and to tell the truth to our readers as best we can.\"</p>", "<p>In November, video cameras captured a tense moment for the <em>Times </em>television show <em>The Weekly</em>. Reporter Silver-Greenberg and Enrich confronted Boies with the encrypted texts between Pottinger and Kessler, prompted by Kessler's questions of how they could make money.</p>", "<p>In their joint interview with NPR, the two <em>Times </em>journalists say they believe Boies was genuinely aghast at the texts they showed him.</p>", "<p>\"He was visibly surprised to see them and I think visibly upset to see them,\" Enrich tells NPR. \"So I don't think he knew. ... He said that he did not intend to do what Stan Pottinger says they were discussing doing. And I can give him the benefit of the doubt on that. \"</p>", "<p>The <em>Times </em>article nonetheless suggests Boies was a willing part of a larger effort to extract large sums of money in settlements from powerful men.</p>", "<p>\"What I think is not fair journalism is to somehow imply I was involved in what was being discussed when the <em>Times </em>knows, and has acknowledged, that I didn't even know about those text messages until they showed them to me,\" Boies tells NPR. He says he is being tarred by the newspaper's conclusions over his friend's texts.</p>", "<p>\"I didn't participate in them. I didn't know about them at the time that they were done,\" Boies says.</p>", "<p>He says his retention agreements with Epstein's accusers allow him only to recoup costs and expenses, not fees from such settlements. NPR has reviewed the agreements, confirmed also by one of his clients. A foundation Boies discussed with Enrich would not have benefited him, Boies says.</p>", "<p>\"As the <em>Times </em>knows, we were not going to make any money out of these cases,\" Boies says.</p>", "<p>The<em> Times</em> team does not fundamentally dispute that contention; its article noted in passing that Boies was working pro bono \u2014 without payment. Even so, Enrich and Silver-Greenberg argue Boies remains a key player.</p>", "<p>\"I don't think it matters whether or not David Boies is going to get rich off these settlements,\" Silver-Greenberg says. \"Burying that information [of sexual assault or misconduct], making it disappear, and letting some of the world's richest, most powerful men off the hook through these legal settlements is the issue.\"</p>", "<p>* * *</p>", "<p>Though Boies had built up a distinguished legal record stretching back more than a half-century, he damaged that reputation badly in two recent episodes, one of which involved the <em>Times </em>directly.</p>", "<p>Boies earned sharp criticism for his close ties to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/05/644844174/theranos-blood-testing-company-accused-of-massive-fraud-says-it-will-dissolve\">Theranos</a>, a blood testing startup that collapsed under accusations of fraud. Its founder now faces federal criminal charges. Boies served as an outside lawyer and a corporate director. The former <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter who exposed the fraud, John Carreyrou, has said Boies' firm acted to <a href=\"https://www.law.com/litigationdaily/2018/05/31/in-new-theranos-book-boies-schiller-doesnt-come-off-so-great/?slreturn=20200111165437\">intimidate whistleblowers</a>. Boies denies that.</p>", "<p>In recent years, Boies' firm did legal defense work for the <em>Times.</em> Then, in late 2017, the newspaper <a href=\"https://apnews.com/f548d2e1877a4e729f89c9306266672e/New-York-Times-fires-lawyer-who-worked-with-Weinstein\">fired Boies Schiller Flexner</a> over revelations he hired a private firm run by former Israeli spies for Harvey Weinstein. As <em>The New Yorker </em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies\">first reported</a>, that firm sought to intimidate the <em>Times' </em>sources and even tailed its reporters. Boies says he was unaware of the extent of the firm's work.</p>", "<p>The <em>Times</em> implied Boies took on the Epstein cases to help restore his reputation: \"By 2019, Mr. Boies, 78, was representing a number of Mr. Epstein's alleged victims.\"</p>", "<p>Boies says he represented his first alleged Epstein victim in 2015, before Theranos became a scandal, and added others subsequently.</p>", "<p>\"I think it's fair to say that [Boies'] representation of Epstein victims has helped him burnish his reputation when he needed it the most,\" Silver-Greenberg says.</p>", "<p>* * *</p>", "<p>The <em>Times</em> has its own checkered backstory in covering Epstein.</p>", "<p>Epstein was first convicted in a Florida state court of a sex crime involving a minor in 2008. After his release from prison, Epstein still held significant sway in New York City, hosting titans of finance, politics, media, academia and high society. He hosted parties at a townhouse that was reportedly the largest in Manhattan. Even so, the <em>Times</em> wrote about Epstein sparingly, and, when it did, even admiringly.</p>", "<p>One financial reporter who kept tabs on Epstein for the <em>Times </em>wrote <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/business/01epstein.html\">a gauzy profile</a> of him that ran just before Epstein was set to enter prison in 2008. Reporter Landon Thomas Jr. mostly portrayed the offense as patronizing prostitutes rather than highlighting it as a crime involving a minor.</p>", "<p>In the summer of 2018, Thomas refused an assignment to call Epstein on a story, citing a conflict. At his request, the financier had made a $30,000 donation to a Harlem cultural center. Enrich, Thomas' editor, ordered him not to write about Epstein again. Thomas was forced to leave the paper at the start of 2019. Enrich says the <em>Times </em>should have told readers about the episode, which the paper has never done.</p>", "<p>The <em>Miami Herald</em>'s Julie K. Brown <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html\">broke the story open</a> in November 2018 by chronicling accusations against Epstein and the failures of major institutions to hold him accountable. Brown says <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/22/753390385/a-dead-cat-a-lawyers-call-and-a-5-figure-donation-how-media-fell-short-on-epstei\">the press is among those institutions</a>. Boies cites the press' failings too.</p>", "<p>\"We filed our first [Epstein] case in 2015. We filed a second case in 2016. And in 2016 we tried to get the <em>Times </em>to write about this,\" Boies says. \"Until July [2019], the <em>Times </em>showed no interest at all in Epstein's victims or in the scope and scale of Epstein's sex trafficking, or even in the fact that the sex trafficking was going on.\"</p>", "<p>Enrich doesn't flinch at the criticism.</p>", "<p>\"I think that we missed the ball on the Epstein coverage,\" says Enrich, who joined the paper in 2017 and is now its business investigations editor. \"I am really disappointed in myself and <em>The New York Times</em> for not having responded as forcefully and as quickly and as aggressively as we should have.\"</p>", "<p>The <em>Times</em> intensified its Epstein coverage after a grand jury handed up indictments against him on more serious charges of sex crimes against minors last summer.</p>", "<p>The Times was also slow to cover developments involving Joichi Ito, then director of the MIT Media Lab. Ito <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/07/758670699/m-i-t-media-lab-director-steps-down-over-financial-ties-to-jeffrey-epstein\">resigned from</a> the New York Times Co. board and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last September as his ties to Epstein came into focus. Ito had solicited contributions for the lab and his own venture fund from Epstein years after the financier's conviction for crimes involving sex with underage teenagers.</p>", "<p>The <em>Times</em> journalists wrote that their report lays bare how \"powerful men buy their way out of legal and reputational jeopardy.\"</p>", "<p>And in interviews, they say their reporting did so in a transparent way, acknowledging false starts and unanswered questions. Their lengthy interview with NPR about the story is part of that transparency, they say.</p>", "<p>\"This is one of the pieces of journalism \u2014 both <em>The Weekly </em>[television show] and the article \u2014 that I'm most proud of,\" Silver-Greenberg says. \"And I'm proud of us for showing our process in this.\"</p>", "<p>* * *</p>", "<p>And what about the man who called himself Patrick Kessler?</p>", "<p>He told the lawyers and the <em>Times</em> reporters that he had material implicating former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Britain's Prince Andrew and Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, who had been a legal adviser for Epstein and served on President Trump's legal team during the Senate impeachment trial. (All have denied any impropriety.)</p>", "<p><em>Times </em>reporters spoke with Kessler repeatedly. One session stretched over eight hours at a Washington hotel conference room and involved two bottles of Japanese whisky, according to the paper.</p>", "<p><em>The Times</em> sought without luck to substantiate Kessler's claims last fall; online searches easily pulled up his supposedly classified documents; a coffee company denied any knowledge of him as an investor; he frequently contradicted his own assertions. (NPR unsuccessfully sought to reach Kessler on a mobile phone number he had used in the past. A message left with a man who said he knew him was not returned.)</p>", "<p>Most important, Kessler failed to deliver any proof of his claims. On the <em>Times </em>show <em>The Weekly</em>, business editor Ellen Pollock describes awaiting delivery of Epstein's computer servers in October from Iceland. The grandiose promise collapsed with Kessler texting about a fire, a missing team member and his own desperate flight to Kyiv.</p>", "<p>The <em>Times </em>team never saw Kessler again.</p>", "<p>\"He didn't even ask for money to be fronted to him,\" Boies says. \"When you conclude a fraud has been committed, the question is, why? He's unlikely to be doing that entirely on his own.\"</p>", "<p>The <em>Times </em>article contains the hint of a question: Was he sent to discredit Boies and Pottinger? And by whom?</p>", "<p>The <em>Times' </em>Enrich says the paper's reporters continuously hunted Kessler \u2014 even after publishing. What was he? A scam artist? An extortionist? A plant? They don't know.</p>", "<p>\"There is not a day in those three months, including weekends, that we were not trying to figure out who Patrick Kessler is, what he actually has, where he comes from, why he's doing this,\" Enrich says.</p>", "<p>The <em>Times </em>journalists say they never thought to wait to publish until they unraveled the secret of Patrick Kessler. They tenaciously held onto the story they sought to tell, as twisty as it turned out to be, alerted to the path by a patently unreliable guide.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

He typically offers an \"elbow bump,\" nudging people gently with his arm. But Sandifer has to fight the deeply ingrained instinct to extend his hand.</p>", "<p>\"You know, people from the South are kind of touchy-feely. That's sort of our nature,\" he says.

Asian cultures \u2014 which typically bow instead of handshake \u2014 also strike a humble and nice tone, he says.</p>", "<p>But the lack of consensus has made greeting people bewildering and, frankly, a bit awkward, and etiquette experts agree.</p>", "<p>Thomas Farley, a New York-based etiquette consultant, says he saw this in full effect over the weekend, when he attended several hands-free greetings, including a birthday party where the host posted a sign reading: \"This is a hug and kiss-free zone.\" </p>", "<p>That was a coronavirus first for Farley.</p>", "<p>\"What I liked about it, honestly, was it took some of the awkwardness out of it so that the ground rules were there so that everybody could not feel like the bad person,\" he says. </p>", "<p>At another party later that same day, people traded elbow bumps and foot shakes \u2014 known also as \"the Wuhan shake,\" after the virus's epicenter. That was weird, Farley says, because this was a house where shoes are left at the door. \"That made foot-to-foot contact a little bit perhaps more intimate than might be if you were actually wearing shoes,\" he says.</p>", "<p>The coronavirus culture is now forcing Farley to rethink how he teaches business etiquette. One core element had been the perfect handshake: Not flimsy \u2014 but not a death grip \u2014 and certainly not clammy.</p>", "<p>\"Now, of course, we're suddenly thrust into this new era,\" he says, although  even the new era has its limits for Farley.</p>", "<p>\"To elbow bump or chest bump. It's just ... it's not professional,\" he says in a tone tinged with disdain. </p>", "<p>His personal preference? \"As a Star Trek fan, I love the <a href=\"https://qz.com/352855/the-secret-history-behind-leonard-nimoys-spock-salute/\">'live long and prosper' greeting</a> with the split fingers.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

But at the Supreme Court Tuesday, the court's conservative majority voiced skepticism about the independent agency Congress created to protect consumers from abuse in the financial services industry.</p>", "<p>In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the CFPB enacted new rules to safeguard the mortgage market and protect consumers from abusive and misleading practices involving everything from credit cards to debt relief. The bureau is headed by a single director,  appointed by the president for a five-year term, and lodged in the Federal Reserve. </p>", "<p>In order to ensure the director's independence, the law bars the president from firing him or her for any reason except malfeasance, inefficiency, or neglect of duty.</p>", "<p>It is that independence from presidential firing that is being challenged as unconstitutional by Seila Law \u2014 a law firm under CFPB investigation for misleading practices \u2014 and the Trump administration. Both the firm and the administration are asking the Supreme Court, if necessary, to strike down a long line of decisions going back almost a century, that uphold the structure of all independent regulatory agencies. </p>", "<p>First up to the lectern Tuesday morning was Seila's lawyer Kannon Shanmugam. \"Never before in American history has Congress given so much executive power to a single individual who does not answer to the President,\" he said. </p>", "<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor interjected: \"You said that no other agency has this single director framework, but there are at least two, including the Social Security Administration ... which affects virtually every American.\" </p>", "<p> Shanmugam replied that the Social Security Administration \"poses no threat to individual liberty.\"</p>", "<p>\"Whose liberty are we speaking of?\" shot back Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   \"What about consumers? ... Congress passed this law so that consumers would be better protected against financial fraud.\"</p>", "<p>Shanmugam pivoted, saying that \"because of its desire to protect consumers\" Congress had improperly created an agency \"insulated from political control.\"</p>", "<p>Representing the Trump administration, Solicitor General Noel Francisco joined in the attack on the CFPB structure. He also got push-back from  Ginsburg who noted that it is unusual for an administration to refuse to defend an act of Congress. </p>", "<p>Francisco replied that the \"general rule is that ... we will defend acts of Congress ... but there is an exception\" when a law infringes on the president's power. This law does that, he said, by not allowing the president to fire the director over policy differences. Other independent regulatory agencies, run by multi-member commissions are different, he argued, because they operate based on consensus. </p>", "<p>The Supreme Court upheld the independence of those agencies in 1935, ruling unanimously that Congress limited the president's power to fire independent commissioners in order to protect those agencies' independence. </p>", "<p>Ours \"is a Constitution that does not say anything about removal\" or \"the structure ... of the government in general,\" noted Justice Elena Kagan. Given that, she asked \"why not leave it to the political branches\" to establish the terms for removal?</p>", "<p>The Constitution grants the president the power to execute the laws, countered Francisco. \"The only way he can do that is if he's fully accountable,\" for his principle officers and they are accountable to him.</p>", "<p>But \"removal is like a nuclear bomb,\" replied Kagan. There are many other ways a president can control officers \u2014 appointment, term limits \u2014 why this one?</p>", "<p>With the Trump administration joining the attack on the CFPB structure, the Supreme Court appointed former Solicitor General Paul Clement to defend the existing law.   </p>", "<p>\"The issue in this case is like the thread on the sweater that if you start tugging on it, and you tug on it hard enough, potentially, the whole sweater comes undone,\" said Clement shortly after receiving the appointment. \"The sweater here really is ... the entirety of the independent agencies ... the whole alphabet soup of agencies.\"</p>", "<p>During arguments Tuesday Clement took a beating from the court's conservatives.</p>", "<p>\"What about the budgetary consequences?\" asked Chief Justice John Roberts. Does that make the head of the CFPB \"sort of ... the effective president over the significant swath of the economy ... they don't even have to go to Congress to get their money\" because they get their budget directly from the Federal Reserve Board. </p>", "<p>Kavanaugh jumped in, wanting to know what is \"enough\" for the president to fire the director of the bureau.  </p>", "<p>Sotomayor stepped in, asking Clement to address \"head on\" the \"assumption that ... the president needs unfettered discretion to execute the laws.\" </p>", "<p>Clement replied that it wasn't true for all presidential powers. For instance, when it comes to independent agencies like the Fed \"we don't want the president to juice up interest rates right before a presidential election.\" </p>", "<p>Similarly, he pointed to the current coronavirus situation, noting \"people are trying to make a political football out of a pandemic ... Congress might decide that the head of the CDC (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) should be protected from removal,\" except for misconduct,\" because that'll make sure that people get good advice\" not political advice. </p>", "<p>Ultimately, he said, these decisions about whether and to what degree to insulate an agency from political control are Congress' call, and Congress has been making these calls for over 100 years. </p>", "<p> Douglas Letter, counsel for the House of Representatives,  was last up to the lectern.</p>", "<p>Like Clement he faced incoming fire from the conservative part of the bench, especially from Kavanaugh, who as a lower court judge in a different case, made clear that he thought the structure of the CFPB is unconstitutional. </p>", "<p>The next president, he suggested, may have to suffer the consequences of a CFPB director appointed by President Trump because the current director's term does not end until 2023.</p>", "<p>But that situation is not unprecedented. Letter pointed to the members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, who are appointed for 14-year terms, which means a one-term president is \"very likely to have almost no influence over the Fed.\" </p>", "<p>At the end of the day, there appeared to be five conservative justices unwilling to recognize that kind of independence for the CFPB, and four liberal justices with an opposite view. </p>", "<p>A decision in the case is expected this summer. </p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

All 157 people on board were killed. </p>", "<p>Authorities in Ethiopia also said training on the Max planes provided by Boeing \"was found to be inadequate\" adding that the flight control system, known as MCAS, was activated four times as pilots struggled mightily to regain control of the plane before the crash. </p>", "<p>The findings of the <a href=\"http://www.aib.gov.et/wp-content/uploads/2020/documents/accident/ET-302%20%20Interim%20Investigation%20%20Report%20March%209%202020.pdf\">interim report</a> from Ethiopia's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau were released a day before the anniversary of the crash of Nairobi-bound <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/10/702077176/157-killed-in-ethiopian-airlines-crash\">Ethiopian Airlines flight 302</a>. </p>", "<p>A Boeing spokesperson said the company continues to extend \"heartfelt sympathies\" to the families of those killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash.

We look forward to reviewing the full details and formal recommendations that will be included in the final report from the Ethiopian Accident Investigation Bureau,\" Boeing said in a statement. </p>", "<p>That doomed flight, plus another one operated by Indonesia's Lion Air that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/25/773532461/investigators-release-scathing-report-faulting-boeing-and-lion-air-for-deadly-cr\">crashed in the Java Sea</a> and killed all 189 passengers and crew in 2018 led to a worldwide grounding of Boeing's 737 Max fleet.

It is designed to lower the nose of the plane if sensors measure the AOA or \"angle of attack\" to be too high, which could cause it to stall. </p>", "<p>But in both crashes, the information from the sensors was wrong. </p>", "<p>In the Ethiopian Airlines flight, authorities found the plane's left and right AOA sensors differed by 59 degrees. The MCAS system took that erroneous information and activated \u2013 repeatedly pushing the plane's nose down during the six minutes it was in the air after takeoff. </p>", "<p>The interim report found that at one point \"the pitch angle dropped from 0.5 degrees nose up to -7.8 degrees nose down\" and as a result the rate of decent increased from 100 feet per minute to more than 5,000 feet per minute. </p>", "<p>The report adds that the pilots appeared to have recognized the problem and powered off the MCAS system. They then attempted to manually regain control and trim of the aircraft in order to bring the nose back up. </p>", "<p>Eventually, the pilots turned the MCAS system back on, though the report does not explain why. That decision again forced the plane into a nose dive and the pilots were unable to recover. </p>", "<p>The report indicates the plane was pointing down at a 40-degree angle and hurtling towards ground at a speed of more than 500 feet per second, when it crashed. </p>", "<p>Ethiopian authorities don't cite pilot error as a cause of the crash, but do say the pilots should have received training in a cockpit simulator on what to do in a scenario when MCAS malfunctions. </p>", "<p>For Boeing, returning the Max to service has been a top priority, though one that has not come easy. Boeing anticipated a swift return, only to see that goal  pushed back several times after regulators, particularly those in the U.S., pushed for more fixes. </p>", "<p>This includes reports that federal regulators will issue an order to have some electrical <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-poised-to-require-electrical-wiring-fixes-before-boeing-737-max-jets-can-fly-again-11583704341\">wire bundles relocated on the Max planes</a> because they are too close to one another and could catch fire.

He says it's certainly appropriate to limit or halt travel to China, some other parts of Asia and a few other destinations around the world.</p>", "<p>\"But in the United States, there are no travel restrictions that have been put in place on anybody by the federal government or a state government,\" he says, adding that there are also no restrictions on travel to Latin and South America, most of Europe and many other places.</p>", "<p>\"So what we're trying to tell people and message people is that, 'Look, travel is still safe,' \" Solombrino says. \"Take the normal precautions you would take: Wash your hands, don't be coughing on people, you know, try to be diligent while you're traveling. But we don't see any reason why people wouldn't be traveling, certainly domestically.\"</p>", "<p>Nonetheless, the media coverage of the spreading coronavirus both in the U.S. and abroad has travelers worked up.</p>", "<p>\"Everyone's freaking out, [saying] 'Oh my God, I gotta cancel my plans, my trip, my this, my that,' \" says Tammy Levent, CEO of Elite Travel. Worried clients have her phone ringing off the hook and her email inbox overflowing.</p>", "<p>\"Travel agents have to become psychiatrists, OK? We have to become therapists for all these people who call in.\"</p>", "<p>Levent says she and many of her fellow travel professionals spend a lot of time educating their clients about the coronavirus and the relatively small risk to most travelers. Levent has been able to talk most clients out of canceling their plans.</p>", "<p>\"I've had one cancellation in all of our thousands of clients, which was to Japan.\"</p>", "<p>Many airlines are offering more flexible flight-change and cancellation policies, even waiving the often hefty fees for changing or canceling a flight booked to certain destinations that are considered at higher risk.</p>", "<p>United Airlines, for example, just announced that it is waiving change fees for any bookings \u2014 domestic and international \u2014 made between now and March 31, in an effort to spur travel or at least cut its losses.</p>", "<p>But Levent warns that those trying to cancel or change flights to destinations where there are no travel restrictions will likely have to pay the full penalty if they do cancel and that regular travel insurance may not help. Only \"cancel for any reason\" policies will allow you to get your money back.</p>", "<p>Still, many of those who are flying this week don't seem too worried.</p>", "<p>Arriving in Los Angeles from Cologne, Germany, Adrian Schmetz, 34, says he thinks the media is overhyping the coronavirus danger.</p>", "<p>\"It's not as lethal as it's made to look like at the moment,\" Schmetz says. \"It's not going to affect my choice of travel at all.\"</p>", "<p>But Los Angeles International Airport parking attendant Myla Maramba says business there is already slowing down, and she worries that a bigger travel slump could lead to a cut in hours or layoffs.</p>", "<p>\"It's going to affect a lot of people's livelihoods,\" she says.</p>", "<p>And that's certainly true as the tentacles of the travel economy reach into the pockets of millions around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

EV boosters concerned about climate change want even more and they say governments should help speed the transition away from internal combustion cars. </p>", "<p>New Jersey passed <a href=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2018/Bills/S2500/2252_U2.HTM\">an ambitious law</a> in January aimed at having 330,000 electric cars on state roads by the end of 2025. And by 2040 New Jersey wants 85% of cars sold in the state to be electric. </p>", "<p>N.J. Gov. Phil Murphy says the law is part of his <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/emp/\">state's goal</a> of reaching 100 percent clean energy by 2050. </p>", "<p>The law  includes up to $300 million in rebates over 10 years to electric vehicle buyers. </p>", "<p>\"And it's not just any old rebate. It's 'cash on the hood' rebate. You walk into a dealer, there's a car that's $35,000, that car's $30,000 to you,\" says Pam Frank, CEO of the group <a href=\"http://www.chargevc.org/\">ChargEVC</a>, which includes utilities, car dealers and environmental groups. </p>", "<p>Frank is not just an advocate for EVs, she's an evangelist. That's why she drives a bright Orange Chevrolet Bolt. </p>", "<p>\"I wanted people to notice I was driving this electric machine, which I'm very proud of,\" Frank says. And if anyone asks she'll tell them it's fun to drive, it's fast, it reduces her carbon foot print and it's quiet. </p>", "<p>Frank's group pushed for the new law, which also calls for charging stations to be built around the state to overcome \"range anxiety,\" or the fear a car's battery will run out with no place to charge. </p>", "<p>The New Jersey law along with incentives in states such as <a href=\"https://cleanvehiclerebate.org/eng\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://goelectric.oregon.gov/incentives-rebates\">Oregon</a> and <a href=\"https://marylandev.org/incentives/\">Maryland</a>, all come at an important time for utilities. After decades of steadily increasing electricity consumption, U.S. <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38572\">demand has leveled off</a>, thanks in part to more efficient appliances and lighting. </p>", "<p>If more EVs are on the road that means utilities will sell more electricity. </p>", "<p>\"New Jersey is an exciting one because outside of California it's probably the biggest piece of legislation that we've seen that's supportive of clean transportation,\" says Chris Budzynski, director of utility policy at <a href=\"https://www.exeloncorp.com/\">Exelon</a>.</p>", "<p>And the law comes as a <a href=\"https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml\">federal tax credit</a> of up to $7,500 is starting to expire. The credits are available for only the first 200,000 cars a manufacturer sells. GM and Tesla already hit that ceiling. </p>", "<p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-16/trump-helped-nix-electric-car-tax-measure-sought-by-tesla-gm\">helped block</a> efforts to raise that limit last December. As a field, <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30705242/democratic-candidates-positions-cars-policy/\">Democratic presidential candidates</a> are much more supportive of EV subsidies. So if voters choose a new president next November more federal help may come. Until then Budzynski is pleased to see states taking action to speed the transition to electric cars. </p>", "<p>\"This does represent one of the most significant or more significant opportunities for us, probably, over the course of the last 100 years with the exception of the introduction of air conditioning,\" Budzynski says. </p>", "<p>Not everyone is happy with this trend. Oil companies, especially those focused on refining, stand to lose gasoline sales if EVs take off. </p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/16/oil-industry-electric-car-1729429\">They've opposed some state efforts</a>, often echoing arguments from consumer advocates such as Stefanie Brand, director of the <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/rpa/\">New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel</a>. Her job is to defend utility customers' interests. </p>", "<p>\"Most of those customers can't afford an electric vehicle because the cheapest electric vehicle at this point is about $30,000,\" Brand says.  </p>", "<p>Often these state programs allow utilities to collect ratepayer money to build things such as charging stations. <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/rpa/docs/A4819_A4634_S2252_Concerning%20the%20Use%20of%20Plug-In%20Electric%20Vehicle_1-3-20.pdf\">Brand says</a> that's not fair because poor ratepayers are subsidizing wealthier ones who can afford an EV. </p>", "<p>Electric car advocates point out everyone benefits from cleaner air and efforts to address climate change. And there are <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/max-baumhefner/electric-vehicles-are-driving-rates-down\">studies</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.synapse-energy.com/sites/default/files/EV-Impacts-June-2019-18-122.pdf\">one focused on California</a> \u2014 the state with the most EVs \u2014 showing a lot more electric cars on the road could actually <em>reduce</em> rates.</p>", "<p>Brand says there's a catch though, \"Until you reach a critical mass of electric vehicles, you're not going to see those effects.\"</p>", "<p>For New Jersey's EV law, Brand says her concerns for poorer ratepayers were addressed. Money from a fund already dedicated to public benefits will be used for the EV rebates. </p>", "<p>Still debates like this will continue as more states seek to boost electric vehicles. In fact, Pam Frank plans to take her orange Bolt and her coalition to neighboring states in the Northeast very soon. </p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

And it says nearly one in 10 boards have no women.</p>", "<p>In 2018, California became the first state to mandate gender diversity in boardrooms with the passage of a bill called SB 826. The measure, requires publicly traded companies based there to have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/01/653318005/california-becomes-1st-state-to-require-women-on-corporate-boards\">at least one female board director</a> \u2014 or face a $100,000 fine.</p>", "<p>At the time, the bill's sponsor, State Sen.

Before the law, 75 firms lacked a female board member, the group found. By the middle of 2019, two-thirds of those companies had added at least one woman to their boards.

Companies have long chosen board members based on their network of friends and acquaintances.</p>", "<p>\"That's where I think the history has led to mostly male boards,\" Kullman said. \"Because if it's word of mouth and you ask the men, historically, they have given a lot of names of other men. So now, we need to do the same.\"</p>", "<p>Kullman, who serves on a total of four corporate boards, says she has developed a network of female executives and is giving recommendations to companies looking for female board members.</p>", "<p>\"I'm not taking on any more boards. I've got plenty. But if people come to me with opportunities, I want to be able to point to four, five, or six different women,\" Kullman said.</p>", "<p>But in the year since its passage, critics have lodged a handful of lawsuits challenging California's law on grounds that it's discriminatory.</p>", "<p>The Pacific Legal Foundation sued California in November on behalf of electronics manufacturer OSI Systems shareholder Creighton Meland, a retired corporate lawyer. <a href=\"https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Creighton-Meland-v.-Alex-Padilla-Secretary-of-State-of-California-Complaint.pdf\">The suit</a> argues that California's gender mandate for boards is unconstitutional.</p>", "<p>\"The law violates the 14th Amendment's promise of equal treatment before the law. And it actually forces people to make decisions on the basis of sex,\" said Anastasia Boden, a senior attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation.</p>", "<p>Plus, Boden says, mandating gender diversity ultimately hurts women \"by relegating them to quota hires and making them seem like space fillers.\"</p>", "<p>As the data trickles in on the first full year of California's law, companies are now looking ahead to complying with the second leg of the law.

By re-sharing extreme \u2014 albeit authentic content \u2014 they're able to manipulate the platform without introducing any additional misinformation.</p>", "<p>\"I think in 2020, we're facing a particularly divisive political moment here in the United States and attempts to capitalize on those divisions among Americans seem to be where malicious actors are heading,\" Roth said.</p>", "<p>The social network has studied fake accounts and coordinated manipulation efforts and have put its new policies to the test during elections in the European Union and India.</p>", "<p>Roth says Twitter has also built a community of experts, including community moderators and partners in government and academia.

Misinformation can also come from American political campaigns trying to use social media to their advantage.</p>", "<p>Roth says he's already seen American 2020 candidates employ questionable tactics to get voters' attention.</p>", "<p>\"We've seen ... accounts that are pretending to be compromised. So they'll sort of pretend that they were hacked and then share content that they might otherwise not have,\" Roth said, along with \"large scale attempts to mobilize volunteers to share content on the service.\"</p>", "<p>While neither of these actions necessarily violate Twitter's policies, there are moments where they can cross the line.</p>", "<p>For example, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign hired hundreds of temporary employees to post campaign messages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.</p>", "<p>Twitter decided to suspend dozens of these pro-Bloomberg accounts. Roth says their decision was not based on the fact that these individuals were being paid to post content.</p>", "<p>\"Our focus whenever we're enforcing our policies is to look at the behavior that the accounts are engaged in, not who we think is behind them or what their motivations were, because in most instances we don't know,\" Roth said.</p>", "<p>Twitter determined that the suspended accounts were \"engaged in spam.\"</p>", "<p>If a large number of people organically decide to post the same message or similar messages at the same time, that isn't likely to qualify as spam, Roth said.</p>", "<p>But if individual users create multiple accounts just for the purpose of tweeting a specific message, then it does. They're over amplifying their voice in a way that constitutes manipulation.</p>", "<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/21/797101409/npr-poll-majority-of-americans-believe-trump-encourages-election-interference\">an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll</a>, 82 percent of Americans think they will read misleading information on social media this election.

To combat false information, Roth says Twitter is trying to highlight information from trustworthy sources.</p>", "<p>For example, while Twitter isn't removing all false information regarding the coronavirus, it's making sure that information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is displayed prominently.</p>", "<p>\"I think a platform has a responsibility to create a space where credible voices can reach audiences that are interested in understanding what they have to say,\" Roth said. </p>", "<p>\"That doesn't mean that we don't allow discussion of these issues throughout the product, but we want to ensure that when you first come to Twitter at the information that you see in our product is going to come from authoritative sources.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

And even if production ramps up, it's unlikely to be enough in the current outbreak.</p>", "<p>Usually, businesses want orders to spike \u2014 they hope customers line up for their products.</p>", "<p>But Bowen is not pleased.</p>", "<p>His company simply can't keep up with demand. 3M \u2014 one of the biggest mask makers \u2014 is in the same predicament.

During what he calls \"peacetime,\" when there are no outbreaks, there are few buyers of masks. During an epidemic, there's suddenly limitless demand.</p>", "<p>\"Imagine if, all at once, millions of people wanted to skateboard,\" Bowen says. <br>\"The skateboarding industry is not set up for spikes like that, and neither is the mask-making industry.\"</p>", "<p>\n                A Prestige Ameritech employee inspects disposable surgical masks in 2009 at the company's Texas factory.

A decade ago, it ramped up production in response to the swine flu outbreak by buying more machines and hiring 150 new workers.</p>", "<p>\"We made a really big mistake,\" Bowen says of that decision. It took about four months to build the new machines, which are as long as a school bus<strong> </strong>and cost as much as $1 million.</p>", "<p>By the time they were ready, the swine flu crisis had ended, demand vaporized, and Prestige Ameritech almost went bankrupt. \"One day \u2014 and it is literally almost like one day \u2014 it just quits.

But the recent shortages also show how a lack of steady orders can create a sudden national security risk.</p>", "<p>The seeds of that problem, says Bowen, can be traced back 15 years. That's when many mask factories moved overseas, where masks could be made at a fraction of Bowen's costs.</p>", "<p>Most notably, he says, Kimberly-Clark, which used to be one of the industry leaders, moved its operations.</p>", "<p>\"The surgical mask supply went from being 90% U.S.-made to being 95% foreign-made in literally one year,\" Bowen says.</p>", "<p>For years, Bowen tried to get the government to pay attention to this issue.

In recent weeks, the <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/boston-symphony-cancels-asia-tour-amid-china-virus-outbreak/2069720/\">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> has cancelled a tour of Asia and Washington, D.C.'s National Symphony Orchestra has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/national-symphony-orchestra-cancels-china-concerts-due-to-coronavirus-outbreak/2020/02/04/2eca06b4-4778-11ea-8124-0ca81effcdfb_story.html\">cancelled three concerts in China</a>. New York's famed Juilliard School, which is scheduled to open a satellite conservatory in Tianjin, China this autumn, announced at the end of January that it has <a href=\"https://www.tianjinjuilliard.edu.cn/news/2020/01/message-tianjin-juilliard-school-precautionary-measures-response-novel-coronavirus/\">suspended</a> all in-person auditions and other admissions-related activities in China and Asia indefinitely.</p>", "<p>The list of American musicians and institutions who have already canceled tours or postponed other activities due to coronavirus concerns covers a broad range, including <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/02/green-day-coronavirus-cancel-tour-bts-1202870666/\">Green Day</a> and <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/coronavirus-american-singer-khalid-postpones-singapore-concert\">Khalid</a>. Even more directly affected are Asian and European musicians who can't perform in their home markets, like the megastar K-pop band <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-southkorea-cases/south-korea-coronavirus-cases-surge-to-2337-bts-cancel-gigs-idUSKCN20M047\">BTS</a> \u2014 who have canceled April dates in their home city of Seoul. In Japan, prime minister Shinzo Abe made a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/japan-schools-coronavirus.html\">request</a> on Feb. 26 that all large cultural and sports events be postponed or canceled across the country; the wide-ranging Hong Kong Arts Festival, which was supposed to take place across February and March with performers from all over the world, was <a href=\"https://www.hk.artsfestival.org/en/\">canceled</a> entirely. </p>", "<p>Similarly, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra canceled all of its performances for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShanghaiSO/status/1223589284344664064?s=20\">February</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShanghaiSO/status/1230800366121496578?s=20\">March</a> due to the health crisis; its musicians have been posting concerts, master classes and audio programs <a href=\"http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/28/WS5e585350a31012821727aeab_1.html\">online</a>, in part to help locals beat the tedium of being quarantined. In Italy, Milan's famed La Scala opera house has <a href=\"http://www.teatroallascala.org/en/coronavirus.html\">canceled</a> a range of upcoming performances, including one featuring conductor Zubin Mehta and the Richard Strauss opera <em>Salome</em>.</p>", "<p>The global reach and frenetic pace of contemporary artists' careers is having an effect as well. Earlier this week, New York's Metropolitan Opera requested that all visiting artists who are arriving from countries already deeply affected by the COVID-19 outbreak \u2014 including Italy, China and South Korea \u2014 to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in New York before beginning rehearsals at the house. </p>", "<p>One of the biggest annual K-pop events in the U.S., a concert sponsored by the Korea Times Media Group that was supposed to feature at least a dozen Korean music acts and which was scheduled to take place at the Hollywood Bowl on Apr. 25, has been <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/02/korea-times-music-festival-postponed-coronavirus-hollywood-bowl-travel-restrictions-1202868776/\">postponed indefinitely</a>.</p>", "<p>But cities that host large-scale music and entertainment gatherings are loathe to cancel events that can be big economic drivers \u2014 and event organizers and local government officials are grappling with those decisions very publicly.</p>", "<p>For example, on Tuesday afternoon, Miami mayor Carlos Gim\u00e9nez wrote on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayorGimenez/status/1234891029549113345?s=20\">Twitter</a>: \"We're not canceling any major events in Miami-Dade County, such as Ultra, following the guidance from Florida's surgeon general on #coronavirus.\" He was referring to the popular, annual Ultra Music Festival, which is scheduled for March 20 to 22, and which last year drew about 170,000 EDM fans. By Wednesday, however, the organizers' thinking seemed to evolve, and Ultra is, according to the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/downtown-miami/article240878956.html\"><em>Miami Herald</em></a>, on the brink of being canceled. (As of publishing time, Ultra had not made an official announcement.) Strikingly, a sister event in the United Arab Emirates \u2014 <a href=\"https://ultra-abudhabi.com/ticket-notice/\">Ultra Abu Dhabi</a>, which was scheduled to take place this Thursday and Friday \u2014 had already been canceled due to <a href=\"https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/coronavirus-ultra-abu-dhabi-music-festival-postponed-1.987193\">coronavirus concerns</a>.</p>", "<p>The annual SXSW conference and festivals in Austin, Texas, encompasses technology,  music and film \u2014 and drew over <a href=\"https://explore.sxsw.com/hubfs/2019-SXSW-Event-Stats_9-10-19.pdf?__hstc=66818801.ae0172ed30b12e03d08bf94f6e0cd022.1578934127416.1583336287233.1583339780423.11&amp;__hssc=66818801.3.1583339780423\">417,000 attendees</a> in 2019, according to organizers' estimates. They say that this year's events, scheduled for March 13 to 22, are still on. (In past years, NPR Music has had a significant presence at SXSW, and as of publication, a range of NPR journalists and employees are scheduled to participate this year as well.)</p>", "<p>On Monday, the organizers put out a statement saying, \"SXSW is working closely on a <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/covid-19-attendee-information/\">daily basis</a> with local, state, and federal agencies to plan for a safe event. ... The health of the Austin community and those who visit our city is our highest priority.\" At a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAnAd0QH8KU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">press conference</a> on March 4, Austin Public Health's Dr. Mark Escott said, \"There is no evidence that closing SXSW or other activities is going to make the community safer.\" Later in his comments, Escott said, \"One of the concerns is if we shut down \u2014 or make the recommendation to shut down \u2014 SXSW, people will still continue to come here. They will travel, they will still do what they were going to do, but without that organizational structure that SXSW provides.\"</p>", "<p>Nevertheless, an online <a href=\"http://www.change.org/p/petition-to-have-sxsw-cancelled-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">petition</a> asking SXSW to cancel this year's event has, as of Thursday afternoon, attracted more than 50,000 signatures. And a number of prominent tech and media companies \u2014 including <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/02/texas-coronavirus-fears-rise-sxsw-marches/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/facebook-joins-twitter-skipping-sxsw-coronavirus-concerns-1282229\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kxan.com/news/coronavirus/facebook-intel-join-twitter-in-pulling-out-of-sxsw-over-coronavirus-fears/\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-and-vevo-cancel-sxsw-plans-amid-coronavirus-fears/2241951\">Vevo</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mashable/status/1234878736832647172?s=20\">Mashable</a>, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/amazon-studios-cancels-sxsw-coronavirus-1203523420/\">Amazon Studios</a>, <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/digital/tiktok-drops-sxsw-appearances-coronavirus-fears-continue-disrupt-festival/2242126\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/netflix-cancels-sxsw-2020-1203524545/\">Netflix</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNNPR/status/1235588096399265793?s=20\">WarnerMedia</a> (which owns CNN and HBO, among other properties) \u2014 have all decided to withdraw from SXSW this year, due to coronavirus fears.</p>", "<p>So have some notable individual speakers, including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and best-selling author Tim Ferriss. On Twitter, Ferriss <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1234860126756012039?s=20\">explained</a> his decision: \"I love SXSW, but I don't believe the novel coronavirus can be contained, and I view an int'l event of 100K+ people as a huge risk to attendees and the entire city, given limited ICU beds, etc. I implore [Austin mayor Steve] Adler and his team to carefully evaluate the downsides. SXSW brings huge economic benefit to Austin, but possibly making Austin a hotspot for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, and the emergency actions and funding that would require, could make a huge event seem shortsighted.\"</p>", "<p>SXSW is downplaying those absences, however \u2014 and in recent days, event organizers have announced a <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/news/2020/tamron-hall-kumail-nanjiani-chris-evans-emily-v-gordon-join-sxsw-2020/\">starry array</a> of speakers added to its lineup, including Hillary Clinton, Rep. Adam Schiff, Katie Couric and RZA.</p>", "<p>On a \"<a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/covid-19-attendee-information/\">COVID-19 attendee information</a>\" page last updated on Monday, the organizers say: \"At this time, there are a handful of cancellations from participants who were traveling from China and Japan and there have been a few corporate travel bans. Other than that, the cancellations are on par from past years.\"</p>", "<p>Undeniably, the event provides a massive economic boost to Austin each year \u2014 according to its own most recent analysis, SXSW was worth nearly <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Press-Release-SXSW-Economic-Impact-2019.pdf\">$356 million</a> to the city in 2019.</p>", "<p>Audience members who have already purchased SXSW passes but who are now uncertain that they want to attend \u2014 or who are being curtailed from traveling to the United States \u2014 seem to be out of luck. According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/criativo/status/1233859651386642435?s=20\">social media posts</a>, individuals who have requested refunds or deferrals to the 2021 edition due to coronavirus issues are being told that their 2020 tickets are nonrefundable.

Dow futures dropped more than 1,000 points, S&amp;P 500 futures hit their limits after tumbling 5%, and the key 10-year Treasury note yield fell below 0.5%, a record low.</p>", "<p>Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest producer, this weekend said it will actually boost oil production instead of cutting it to stem falling prices, in a dramatic reversal in policy. </p>", "<p>Late last week, Saudi Arabia, the rest of OPEC and Russia failed to agree on production cuts to combat falling prices because of fears that the coronavirus epidemic will halt world economic growth. Oil prices were down more than 30% this year before Sunday's collapse.</p>", "<p>U.S. consumers are likely to see lower prices at the gas pump, but American oil producers \u2014 who lead the world in output \u2014 could be hurt by the oil price slide.</p>", "<p>Economies from China to Italy have ground to a halt as quarantines shut down factories and demand for products and services craters.</p>", "<p>Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members sought to cut production to shore up oil prices. But the once-powerful cartel can no longer move markets alone. It needs the support of Russia, which is not an OPEC member but has recently been coordinating with the organization.</p>", "<p>Yet Russia has resisted calls for production cuts. On Friday, the talks ended in failure. OPEC and its allies announced no new reductions and didn't even commit to extending current cuts.</p>", "<p>So, Saudi Arabia is doing an about-face. If it can't get the price back up, it's going to drive the price way down. It's offering to cut the oil price for the U.S. market by <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/audi-oil-prices/update-1-saudi-arabia-slashes-april-crude-oil-prices-after-opecs-supply-pact-collapsed-idUSL8N2B00TK\">$7 per barrel</a>, to Europe by $8 and Asia by $6. Paired with Saudi Arabia's ability to rapidly increase production \u2014 flooding the market with cheap crude \u2014 those unilateral price cuts will push the price of oil down for everyone.</p>", "<p>Low oil prices are bad for Saudi Arabia's budget, and the price of the Saudi oil company Aramco's stock <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/08/saudi-aramco-shares-fall-below-ipo-price-for-first-time-gulf-stocks-plummet-after-opec-deal-failure.html\">tumbled below its initial public offering price</a> on Sunday.

Brittany Pettersen with her husband Ian Silverii and their dog Ollie, last August in their home in Colorado. Petterson, who gave birth to the couple's son this year, has lobbied hard to expand paid family and medical leave throughout the state.</p>", "<p>When <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/legislators/brittany-pettersen\">Brittany Pettersen</a>, a Colorado state senator, gave birth to a boy in January, she became only the second lawmaker in the state to have a baby during a legislative season.<br><strong></strong></p>", "<p>The first, Sen. Barbara Holme, delivered just two days before lawmakers adjourned nearly 40 years ago. But because she was part of a Democratic minority at the time, no one worried much about the votes Holme was missing, much less her need for paid maternity leave.</p>", "<p>\"That was the year I was born,\" says Pettersen, also a Democrat. \"Unfortunately, we haven't come very far from 1981.\"</p>", "<p>Despite the inroads women have made entering the workforce and politics, paid family and medical leave remains a heavy lift in Colorado and across much of the country. For each of the past six years, the Colorado legislature has considered bills to establish a statewide paid leave program, but none have passed.</p>", "<p>Yet this year, with a Democratic governor, Democratic control of both the state House and Senate, plus more female legislators than ever before, many thought it would be the best chance for a paid leave bill in the 30 years since Holme had her baby.</p>", "<p>Pettersen has become something of a poster child \u2014 perhaps, a poster mom \u2014 for this year's legislative push. While undoubtedly many male lawmakers have had children while serving, her fellow senators may find Pettersen's example hard to ignore if a paid leave bill comes to the floor.</p>", "<p>\"This is our opportunity to help Coloradans. And we're going through it, even in our workplace,\" says Pettersen, who took one month of paid leave from her legislative work. (Colorado legislators are allowed to take up to 40 days of fully compensated leave, but their salary is reduced if they're out longer for anything other than a medical illness.)</p>", "<p>Still, even after a bipartisan task force came to broad consensus this year for a mandatory paid family leave benefit run by the state and funded through payroll taxes, Coloradans may have to settle for something far less ambitious if anything passes at all. The fight illustrates just how divisive paid family leave can be when determining how to pay for it.</p>", "<p><strong>Legislative hurdles</strong></p>", "<p>Under federal law, employers with 50 or more employees are required to grant workers time off to deal with family or medical issues, including the birth of a child or the care of an aging parent. But companies are not required to pay workers for that time off.</p>", "<p>Many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have backed paid leave and President Donald Trump's budget envisioned a paid family leave program. Congress is now considering the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act that would provide workers up to 12 weeks of partial income for family leave regardless of the company's size, funded through a payroll tax of 2 cents per $10 in wages. Congress passed a bill last year that will grant 12 weeks of paid family leave to federal employees, beginning in October.</p>", "<p>Some states have sought to fill the gaps and, so far, eight states \u2014 California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington \u2014 along with the District of Columbia have established paid family leave programs, funded through payroll taxes. For a while, at least, Colorado looked poised to join them.</p>", "<p>Colorado Republicans have killed paid leave bills in years past. But last year, when Democrats took control, paid leave looked like a possibility.</p>", "<p>\"That's also when all the details really started to matter,\" says Kathy White, deputy director of the Colorado Fiscal Institute, a nonprofit research and policy advocacy organization, which backed a paid leave benefit.</p>", "<p>As a result, the 2019 paid leave bill was the most lobbied legislation in Colorado that session, according to backers, with more than 200 lobbyists registered as working on it. But, ultimately, lawmakers were unable to come to an agreement and instead established a task force to study the issue.</p>", "<p><strong>A broad consensus</strong></p>", "<p>The 13-member bipartisan panel spent months poring through examples from other states and studies that looked at the costs and benefits of providing family and medical leave. They reviewed more than 1,000 public comments submitted in just 30 days.</p>", "<p>In January, the task force issued its final recommendations with broad consensus among its members. It backed what's called a state-run social insurance model to levy a small payroll tax to cover the paychecks of those taking paid leave.</p>", "<p>\"This has become a really big issue because the research is becoming so clear,\" White says. \"We can see the difference between those who have leave and those who don't have leave or have to take unpaid leave for caregiving needs.\"</p>", "<p>A state-commissioned review found strong evidence that paid leave decreased infant mortality by 10% to 13%, increased the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months, increased childhood immunization rates and improved maternal mental health.</p>", "<p>But the task force recommendations were met with objections from various lawmakers, as well as Gov. Jared Polis. He had asked the task force to consider paid leave models other than a state-run program.</p>", "<p>Some opposed the new payroll taxes, while others were concerned about the state's potential costs if payroll taxes don't collect enough. Critics have argued that paid leave mandates offer employers little flexibility to meet an employee's specific needs \u2014 and can create an economic burden for businesses.</p>", "<p>By February, the bill's sponsors had shifted to a compromise that would require companies to offer paid family and medical time off, but would leave it up to employers to determine how to provide that.</p>", "<p>It's not nearly the benefit that paid-leave advocates had hoped for.</p>", "<p>\"I would have preferred a social insurance plan,\" says Democratic Sen. <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/legislators/faith-winter\">Faith Winter</a>, the bill's lead sponsor. \"Ultimately, you could have a perfect bill that doesn't pass, or you could have a good bill that passes.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Waning support</strong></p>", "<p>Now it's unclear whether the compromise bill has given up too much ground to pass. Already, two of Winter's Democratic co-sponsors have dropped their names from the revised bill, calling into question whether it will have enough votes.</p>", "<p>\"It's a big program with lots of details, and it impacts every person in the state,\" Winter says. \"When you start moving things that affect everyone and every business, that means everyone cares.\"</p>", "<p>The coalition of nonprofits and advocacy groups pushing for paid family and medical leave does have a backstop. Early this year, proponents registered two paid leave ballot measures for the November elections.</p>", "<p>\"Colorado families overwhelmingly want and expect the legislature to move forward with a plan to provide family and medical leave this year,\" says Lynea Hansen, a spokesperson for <a href=\"https://www.coloradofamiliesfirst.org/\">Colorado Families First</a>, a nonprofit that has been lobbying in favor of a paid leave bill. \"If the legislature is unsuccessful at passing a comprehensive policy, we plan to take this initiative to the voters.\"</p>", "<p>It's unknown whether the backers of the ballot measure would continue to press the issue if the legislature passes the compromise bill instead of the full state-run benefit advocates sought.</p>", "<p>\"What happens if the legislature does do something and it's still not good enough for the advocates?\" asks <a href=\"https://cochamber.com/staff/loren-furman/\">Loren Furman</a>, senior vice president of state and federal relations for the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, which has been supportive of a paid leave bill. \"Are they then going to continue down the path of the ballot initiative?\"</p>", "<p>If nothing else, the additional time it took to rework the bill has allowed Pettersen to be back from her one-month maternity leave in time for debate on the bill. The Democrats hold a slim 19-16 margin in the Senate and cannot count on a strict party-line vote, because some party members are wavering in their support for the new approach.</p>", "<p>Pettersen has pledged to bring her infant son, Davis, to the chamber floor for the crucial vote \u2014 a tangible display of what's at stake.</p>", "<p>\"It's just another reminder,\" she says. \"There are numerous moms that have been elected. But absolutely, having the experience of someone going through it right now is going to impact what we're talking about.\"</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://khn.org/\"><em>Kaiser Health News</em></a><em> is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

But personally, Wasserstrum is no fan of remote work. He says it's impossible to read a room over a conference line. Plus, about a third of SquareFoot's staff are brokers \u2014 they tour buildings with clients.</p>", "<p>\"If all of a sudden they said you can't have face-to-face meetings with people, it'd be harder for us to do a bunch of those transactions,\" Wasserstrum says.</p>", "<p>In fact, remote work isn't always possible. Fewer than half could do so at least some of the time,<a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/206033/america-coming-workplace-home-alone.aspx?utm_source=link_wwwv9&amp;utm_campaign=item_236222&amp;utm_medium=copy\"> according to one Gallup survey</a>. Hourly workers don't get paid if they don't work, and those in retail, manufacturing, or health care usually must be physically present to work.</p>", "<p>But it's a huge recruitment tool, and a big perk for people like Tristan Guyette, a field manager for a nonprofit who loves working from home in Toledo, Ohio.</p>", "<p>\"For me, it's a lot easier to work in silence,\" Guyette says. \"I also appreciate the fact that I can migrate from room to room, if I'm not feeling super productive.\"</p>", "<p>Guyette has a weak immune system and can relate to the many remote workers around the world staying home for health reasons. </p>", "<p>Webcams are good stand-ins for in-person meetings, Guyette says. \"I also realize not everybody is built for this.

His company ordered loads of hand sanitizer and told employees to come back to the office.</p>", "<p>\"I don't believe people are as productive at home,\" he says. But he may rethink that.

And while the federal government in the U.S. has backed away from climate targets, cities and states \u2014 not to mention governments abroad \u2014 are taking action.</p>", "<p>There might be some more surprising sources of pressure, too. Children. </p>", "<p>\"I hear from business leaders all the time today that, you know, their kids come home and say, 'What are you doing, Dad?' \" says Elizabeth Sturcken, a managing director at the Environmental Defense Fund who works with businesses on sustainability goals. \"This makes a difference.\" </p>", "<p>Employees, too, are increasingly influential. Workers at companies such as Amazon are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/19/762336929/amazon-makes-climate-pledge-as-workers-plan-walkout\">pushing their bosses to change</a>, and some other companies see this as a way to attract and retain talent.</p>", "<p>Kyum Kim is the co-founder of the app Blind, where tech workers discuss their workplaces, and he says those workers are increasingly discussing issues like climate change. In a survey, half his users <a href=\"https://www.teamblind.com/blog/index.php/2020/02/10/companies-that-take-on-climate-change-retain-more-talent/\">said </a>a company's climate policy affects whether they want to work there. </p>", "<p>\"People talk a lot about compensation, of course, and the work culture,\" he says, \"but I think this is a whole new segment.\" </p>", "<p>There's another factor, too, according to Lucas Joppa, the chief sustainability officer at Microsoft. </p>", "<p>He says it helps to frame climate action as an accounting problem, based on quantifying exactly how much companies emit and how much they'll need to cut. </p>", "<p>\"That really is what I see flip executives' mindsets around, is to just talk about this in terms that they understand ... a climate 'budget,' \" Joppa says. \"At the end of the day, what companies are really good at doing is making decisions based on numbers.\"</p>", "<p><strong>The limits of voluntary targets</strong></p>", "<p>Of course, setting a carbon budget is one thing. Sticking to it is another. Some climate announcements in the past \u2014 such as BP's previous rebranding as \"Beyond Petroleum\" \u2014 have been more PR push than actual shift in strategy, and advocates agree that follow-through and accountability will be essential if these new ambitious targets are to have an impact. </p>", "<p>And even if companies make good on their promises, some experts say there can be a danger in relying on big corporations to drive the fight against climate change.</p>", "<p>Shalanda Baker, a professor at Northeastern University who studies the social justice dimensions of a transition away from fossil fuels, says vulnerable and marginalized communities need to have input in how the world fights climate change \u2014 and feel the benefits of a switch to green energy. </p>", "<p>\"I'm just not sure if I have the faith, given that ... corporations are very concerned about expenses and profits, that they would really think about something that may add cost, but that may be more just,\" she says.</p>", "<p>Baker says corporate action can be powerful but government policy can make sure vulnerable populations are protected. </p>", "<p>She's not the only one who looks at these voluntary commitments and sees a need for regulation. After all, <em>some </em>companies taking action is nowhere near enough to stop climate change. </p>", "<p>Elizabeth Sturcken at the EDF, who has spent two decades urging companies to act, tells companies that in addition to voluntary cuts in emissions, it's critical for business leaders to engage with policymakers and ask for government action. </p>", "<p>Corporations from <a href=\"https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/sustainability/climate-change/our-role-in-advancing-the-energy-transition/carbon-pricing.html\">BP </a>to PepsiCo say they support a <a href=\"https://www.ceres.org/news-center/press-releases/LEAD-on-carbon-pricing\">price on carbon</a>, one market-based policy for reducing emissions.

Pasadena, where I opened the first one, was because Pasadena is the epitome of a well-educated town,\" he explained. \"I reframed this: Trader Joe's is for overeducated and underpaid people, for all the classical musicians, museum curators, journalists \u2014 that's why we've always had good press, frankly!\"</p>", "<p>As for that nautical theme, well, Coulombe really leaned in.</p>", "<p>\"I read that the [Boeing] 747 [aircraft] would radically reduce the cost of travel, and I came up with the term 'Trader' to evoke the South Seas. The first stores were loaded with marine artifacts. We'd go down to the docks in San Pedro, we'd buy flags, chains, all that stuff. I [put] walk-in boxes in the shape of ships with cannon in the middle of the stores,\" he adds. \"That was a terrible idea.\"</p>", "<p>Coulombe and the fledgling company went one step further in 1972, launching the Trader Joe's label and slapping quirky names on healthy, relatively low-priced foods such as granola, the company's first private-label product.</p>", "<p>And then, of course, there was also eventually the famously cheap Charles Shaw wine \u2014 perhaps better known by the nickname \"two-buck Chuck\" in California. There were other local wines in stock too, of course.</p>", "<p>\"I accidentally created the world's largest assortment of Californian wine. In 1967 nobody was interested in wine, let alone Californian wines,\" he recalled in a <a href=\"https://coriolisresearch.com/pdfs/coriolis_joe_coulombe_interview.pdf\">2005 interview</a> with Coriolis Research. \"We were the first to give shelf space to what later became known as boutique Californian wineries.\"</p>", "<p>Beth Kowitt, who reported on the company for <em>Fortune</em> magazine, explained the company's process to NPR <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/08/26/129444917/trader-joe-s-successful-but-secretive\">in 2010</a>.</p>", "<p>\"They buy directly from producers whenever possible, which takes out a lot of costs. So there are no middlemen involved. So they're not going through distributors,\" Kowitt said. \"Also, because they're buying in such large volume, they can secure large discounts from producers.\"</p>", "<p>In the end, the names, the types of products, the exotic decor \u2014 it continued to have a particular consumer in mind.</p>", "<p>\"All this stuff aimed at the subliminal,\" Coulombe said in 2005, \"so that when the well-educated person walks down the aisle they know, without anything shouting at them, they know that they are in an outlet aimed at the well educated person.\" </p>", "<p>He sold his stake in the company to the owner of Aldi Nord, a German grocery chain, in 1979, though he stayed on as chief executive until finally retiring from Trader Joe's in 1988.

Click here.</strong></em></a></p>", "<p>Mortgages tend to rise and fall with 10-year Treasury yields. So nervous investors piling into bonds have helped <a href=\"http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/\">push down mortgage rates</a>, which have fallen about a full percentage point over the past year.</p>", "<p>That's a good thing, says Laurie Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute. She says that buying a home is crucial for most Americans to build wealth and that these lower rates can mean hundreds or thousands of dollars a year in lower mortgage payments.</p>", "<p>\"Homeownership is really the single best way to build wealth,\" Goodman says. The median homeowner has a net worth of around $230,000 \u2014 nearly half of that is in the form of equity in their home, she says. Meanwhile, Goodman adds, the median renter has total wealth of less than $5,000.</p>", "<p>If you have good credit, rates on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage have dropped from about 4.5% to around 3.5% over the past year. Goodman says that this effectively makes the same-priced house from a year ago more than 10% cheaper today in monthly mortgage payments.</p>", "<p>So, she says, someone who was on the fence a year ago about whether they could afford to own a home \"is going to find it very attractive at this time.\"</p>", "<p>Millions of people around the country who are already homeowners could probably save money on their monthly payment by refinancing. But it can be a little tricky to figure out if that's worth doing.</p>", "<p>Elysia Stobbe works in the mortgage industry and is the author of the book <em>How to Get Approved for the Best Mortgage Without Sticking a Fork in Your Eye</em>.</p>", "<p>\"People see rates are low or rates are dropping, so we get a lot of calls,\" she says. \"People just want us to run the numbers and make sure it makes sense.\"</p>", "<p>Stobbe says that on a $300,000 30-year fixed-rate loan, if you were at 4.5% and refinanced at 3.5%, that would save you about $2,000 a year in mortgage payments. So that sounds pretty good.</p>", "<p>\"Yes, the monthly savings is great,\" she says, \"but what are the fees involved?\"</p>", "<p>Stobbe says the fees vary a lot from state to state. In Florida, you might have to pay thousands of dollars more than in Virginia or Georgia, she says. So she says you want to think about how long it will take to break even on paying those fees before you actually save any money.</p>", "<p>And there's one last <em>very</em> important thing to consider, especially if you've been paying your mortgage for a long time, say five or 10 years. When you get a new 30-year loan, you go back to year one on your payments. That matters a lot because in those early years you're paying much more interest than you are principal. So you're not paying down what you owe on the house that much.</p>", "<p>\"Absolutely,\" Stobbe says, \"on any loan, the interest is front-loaded.\"</p>", "<p>Think about this like eating a sandwich. The mayonnaise is the interest you pay the bank. The meat is the principal \u2014 the amount that goes toward building equity and actually owning more of your home.</p>", "<p>The first couple of years on a new 30-year loan, you're basically eating a mayonnaise sandwich.

In the long run, so too could the fate of independent regulatory agencies that have long governed everything from monetary policy to public health and safety.</p>", "<p><strong>A new watchdog for a broken system</strong></p>", "<p>In 2008, the U.S. economy was on<a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-financial-crisis\"> the brink of financial disaster</a>. Following nearly two decades of deregulation, U.S. banks had been offering home loans to people with poor credit, overleveraging and engaging in widespread, excessive lending practices, resulting in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.</p>", "<p>\n                Richard Cordray, the CFPB's first director\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    John Minchillo/AP\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Richard Cordray, the CFPB's first director</p>", "<p>In 2010, Congress sought to reestablish oversight and regulation of the financial system. Among the remedies enacted was a law that consolidated the consumer protection powers of seven agencies into one \u2014 the CFPB. Placed in the offices of the Federal Reserve and funded directly by the Fed, the new agency was charged with protecting consumers and preventing a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>", "<p>\"The CFPB had two roles. One was to try to prevent an economic collapse of that kind ever happening again, and that was done largely through putting in place rules that safeguarded the mortgage market and ferreted out a lot of the irresponsible and ultimately failed lending that had occurred,\" says Richard Cordray, the first director of the CFPB. The other, he says, was \"to protect consumers.\"</p>", "<p>Once in place, the bureau moved aggressively to protect consumers from bad actors in the banking and financial services sector. A prime example was the crackdown on Wells Fargo. The bank <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-fines-wells-fargo-100-million-widespread-illegal-practice-secretly-opening-unauthorized-accounts/\">faced heavy fines</a> for creating an estimated 3.5 million fake deposit accounts and fake credit cards in the names of people who didn't authorize them and for improperly repossessing the cars of military personnel. Also in the CFPB's sights \u2014 bill collectors, telemarketers and others accused of misleading consumers.</p>", "<p><strong>The CFPB under fire</strong></p>", "<p>Among those facing scrutiny \u2014 Seila Law, a law firm in California, which was under investigation on allegations that it charged consumers illegal upfront fees for debt relief services and that it deceived consumers about those services with misleading advertising and marketing material.</p>", "<p>As part of its investigation, the CFPB issued a letter to Seila demanding documents. The firm refused to comply, contending that the structure of the agency is unconstitutional because its director cannot be fired \"at will\" by the president. Instead, the bureau's director, like the leaders of other independent federal agencies, can only be fired by the president \"for cause\" \u2014 specifically, inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance.</p>", "<p>Seila lost that argument in the lower courts, but now the Supreme Court will take a crack at the case. Tuesday's arguments will center on a longstanding Supreme Court decision that forms the basis for all independent federal agencies.</p>", "<p>In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt fired William Humphrey, one of five commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission. Roosevelt didn't have a problem with Humphrey's job performance. The sole reason for the dismissal was that Humphrey had been appointed by the previous president, Republican Herbert Hoover, and was a conservative who disagreed with Roosevelt's policy views. Because the FTC had oversight over many progressive New Deal policies, Roosevelt wanted Humphrey replaced with his own appointee.</p>", "<p>The Supreme Court ruled in 1935 unanimously that the president could not dismiss FTC commissioners the way he could his own Cabinet or other members of his administration. It said that Congress had created the FTC to perform quasi-judicial, quasi-legislative functions and therefore intended it to be politically independent. The Humphrey decision has been reaffirmed dozens of times since it was decided 85 years ago.</p>", "<p>On Tuesday, however, Seila Law and the Trump administration will argue that the Humphrey decision does not apply to the CFPB. They say the bureau is different because its power rests in the hands of a single director, as opposed to a multimember commission.</p>", "<p><strong>Preserving executive power</strong></p>", "<p>It is an argument that is likely to find support among the five conservative members of the current court.</p>", "<p>Before joining the court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh in particular <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-that-shaped-brett-kavanaughs-thinking-on-presidential-power-1535744028\">took issue with the Humphrey decision repeatedly</a>. But he is not alone, Justice Neil Gorsuch believes that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/07/636108610/is-trump-about-to-be-able-to-say-you-re-fired-to-a-lot-more-people\">the executive has been unconstitutionally weakened</a> by a surplus of independent regulatory agencies and executive branch officials that are beyond the president's control. Justice Samuel Alito expressed similar views before joining the court, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113642811283938270\">saying of the presidency</a>, \"the president has not just some executive powers, but <em>the </em>executive power \u2014 the whole thing.\"</p>", "<p>Supporting that view is much of the business community.</p>", "<p>\n                Andrew Pincus argues that the CFPB's single-director structure makes it different from the multimember independent agencies in much of the nation's regulatory structure.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    J.

The president picks the chairman \"who has a lot of control about how [the agency] operates. The terms are staggered, so most presidents will have an opportunity to appoint a number of those people.\" And the very fact that they are multimember agencies means there has to be a majority in order to act. All of that, Pincus says, \"is a check on the exercise of government power\" and none of those features exists when an agency has a single director.</p>", "<p>The Chamber of Commerce has not asked the court to go further than distinguishing between the CFPB and agencies governed by a multimember board.</p>", "<p>The Trump administration, however, is willing to go all the way, telling the court that if need be, it should reverse the 1935 Humphrey decision and make all independent federal agencies completely subservient to the president.</p>", "<p><strong>No government defense for the CFPB</strong></p>", "<p>Typically, the Department of Justice defends federal agencies facing legal challenges. But the Trump administration agrees with Seila Law, meaning there was nobody to defend the CFPB in this case. So, the Supreme Court appointed former Solicitor General Paul Clement, a noted conservative, to argue on behalf of the bureau.</p>", "<p>\n                Attorney Paul Clement warns the CFPB case risks unraveling the dozens of regulatory federal agencies.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Attorney Paul Clement warns the CFPB case risks unraveling the dozens of regulatory federal agencies.</p>", "<p>The Constitution says nothing about the president's power to remove officers who have been confirmed by the Senate, observes Clement.</p>", "<p>And he points out that the CFPB's single-director structure is not unique among independent federal agencies. Among those with a single director are the Comptroller of the Currency and the Social Security Administration.</p>", "<p>\"The issue in this case is like the thread on the sweater that if you start tugging on it, and you tug on it hard enough, potentially, the whole sweater comes undone,\" he says. \"The sweater here really is ... the whole alphabet soup of agencies that all have these for-cause protections.\"</p>", "<p>Start to unravel the sweater in the CFPB case, he contends, and you may well end up unraveling the dozens of federal agencies that regulate everything from the nation's health and safety to its monetary policy, including the dozens of agencies that are governed by multimember commissions.</p>", "<p>\"The Federal Reserve is a great example of why Congress imposes these kinds of restrictions,\" so as to protect some of our most important institutions from destabilizing political crosscurrents, Clement says.</p>", "<p>The Trump administration, however, is willing to roll the dice. It argues that if a single-member agency cannot be distinguished from a multimember agency, the court should reverse the 85-year-old Humphrey decision, and all of the decisions that followed it.</p>", "<p>That would throw into doubt not just the CFPB, but also independent agencies that make up roughly a third of the government \u2014 and, potentially, the rules and regulations that those agencies have laid down over the years.</p>", "<p><strong>The end of independent agencies?</strong></p>", "<p>Former CFPB Director Cordray cautions against that approach. He points out that even the Mortgage Bankers Association filed a brief in this case, saying, \"Whatever you do, don't strike down the agency as a whole because it would cause chaos in the mortgage market. The rules that are in place, we've all adjusted to those, those are working well.\"</p>", "<p>The Supreme Court majority likely would want to avoid a decision that causes chaos. But the conservative court majority is made up of five justices who, to one degree or another, have indicated a hostility to the notion of independent agencies. The question is, how far do they want to go?</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

In this episode, we help you weigh the pros and cons of renting versus owning.</p>", "<p>Of course there are some tools out there to help you decide, like a rent vs. buy calculator. (Here are a few we recommend: <a href=\"https://www.trulia.com/rent_vs_buy/\">Trulia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=1\">NYT's The Upshot</a>, <a href=\"http://calculators.freddiemac.com/response/lf-freddiemac/calc/home10\">Freddie Mac</a>). But the decision to purchase or rent is about way more than just money. We walk you through six things to consider as you're making the decision. </p>", "<p><strong>1. Keep in mind: Owning a home is the No. 1 way most Americans build wealth.</strong></p>", "<p>The average net worth of a homeowner is much larger than that of a renter, says Alanna McCargo, vice president for <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/housing-finance-policy-center\">housing finance policy at the Urban Institute</a>. In 2016, the average homeowner's net worth was $231,420; the average net worth of a renter was $5,200.</p>", "<p>\"Families have built wealth for generations and financial security over time as a result of their owning a home,\" McCargo says. Building wealth through home equity is a huge factor to consider as you think about whether you want to rent or own.</p>", "<p><strong>2. Buying a house is not an automatic ticket to the good life, and it may not make you happier.</strong></p>", "<p>If you take wealth accumulation out of the equation, research hasn't shown definitively that buying a home makes people happier, says Elizabeth Dunn, a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia. She studies how time, money and technology shape human happiness.</p>", "<p>\"You know, if anything, homeowners seem to experience a little bit more pain from their homes,\" Dunn says. Renters don't have to fix the water heater when it breaks, make sure their mailbox matches the other ones in the neighborhood, replace the roof every 15 years.</p>", "<p>The costs of homeownership go well beyond the monthly mortgage payment, says Michelle Singletary, a personal finance author and columnist with <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p>", "<p>\"I'm still a big believer in homeownership \u2014 obviously, I've been a homeowner since my second year out of college,\" Singletary says. \"I just believe that you need to take it slow, understand what it means.\"</p>", "<p><strong>3. Renting gives you flexibility.</strong></p>", "<p>Renters have one definite benefit over owners: It's a lot easier to pick up and move, whether to escape noisy neighbors or follow a job offer across the country.</p>", "<p>Especially when you're younger, Dunn says, you may be happier having the flexibility to travel and teach English in Thailand and pursue other adventures like that, rather than spend money and time dealing with plumbing problems and leaky roofs.</p>", "<p><strong>4. The flexibility of renting comes with a cost: Rent will always go up.</strong></p>", "<p>Inflation alone pushes rents up over time \u2014 and if the neighborhood gets trendy, monthly rents can go through the roof.</p>", "<p>But if you own your home (and you have a fixed-rate mortgage, which means your interest rates won't change over the life of your mortgage), your monthly payment is a fixed cost. McCargo says that this offers peace of mind. And as inflation rises, living in your home gets effectively cheaper over the long term.</p>", "<p>\"Not to mention, every single month, you're paying something down every time you make that mortgage payment,\" says McCargo, thereby building your equity in your home and reducing your debt load.</p>", "<p><strong>5. You don't need a big down payment to own a home.</strong></p>", "<p>Homeownership might have a lower price of entry than you think. A 20% down payment was once standard, but McCargo says the average today is 5% of the total. </p>", "<p>Keep in mind that if you put down less than 20%, you'll likely have to pay a monthly private mortgage insurance (PMI). This can add hundreds to your monthly payments. On many loans, you can request to cancel the PMI once you have a loan to value ratio of 80% (meaning the home is worth 20% more than you owe.) The lender should cancel PMI automatically once the ratio reaches 78%. The exception is with FHA loans, where PMI is permanent unless you refinance.</p>", "<p>First-time buyers can find programs that offer mortgages with even lower down payments. Some cities offer grants to help with down payments to encourage people to invest in their communities. A good place to go to find out about such incentives is your state's housing finance agency.</p>", "<p><strong>6. Owning a home can give you a sense of security \u2014 and that can be priceless.</strong></p>", "<p>Singletary was surprised by the profound sense of both security and accomplishment she felt from buying her own place.</p>", "<p>\"I had been raised by my grandmother, and the circumstances in which I came to live with her were not great,\" she says. \"I was thinking, 'Wow, this is super cool \u2014 that this kid who was thrown away and almost ended up in foster care, here she is, at 22. I own my own home.' It was a great deal of satisfaction and pride that I had done this, against all odds.\"</p>", "<p><em>We'd love to hear from you.

You can </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money\">sign up here</a>.</p>", "<p>Last month, Daniel Tamasi, an IT manager in St. Louis, Missouri, decided he wanted to take some extra precautions against coronavirus. He has a two-year old, and he and his wife are expecting, so he started searching online for masks to protect his family. \"I thought it was going to be my usual two-to-three minute Amazon search and, you know, I'd be done with it,\" he says.  </p>", "<p>He quickly found out that Amazon didn't offer its standard, two-day shipping for Prime members like him. In fact, the earliest he could find a delivery was about a month out. \"So I went to the online stores of basically every major pharmacy \u2014 CVS, Walgreens, Target, and those sort of places \u2014 and they were all out of stock.\" Next he tried brick-and-mortar retailers around St. Louis. Still no luck.  </p>", "<p>Finally, Tamasi turned to eBay. He searched for masks there, and they were crazy expensive. The cheapest masks he could find on eBay, he says, were about four times their typical sticker price.  </p>", "<p>Around the world, people like Tamasi are scrambling for masks, and prices are rising. According to online price tracker Keepa, a 30-pack of 3M's popular N95 mask was selling on Amazon for <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/keepa.com/*!product/1-B000GUP7X4__;Iw!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CFEfaLOXw%24\">$199.95</a> last Tuesday. Normally, it's about 15 bucks. According to Nielsen, a retail tracker, sales of medical masks have seen a 319% surge in national sales over the last month compared to the same time last year. And <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-face-masks-prestige-ameritech-demand/__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CFCS22dgQ%24\">manufacturers are struggling</a> to supply the demand.  </p>", "<p>For economists like George Mason's Tyler Cowen, this is all the sign of a properly functioning market. Higher prices are the market's way of screaming: We need more masks!  \"The normal economic view is that prices should be left free to make supply and demand equal,\" Cowen says.  </p>", "<p>Higher mask prices, he says, have at least two benefits. One is that people who need them the most are more likely to get them. At this moment, the CDC only recommends masks for medical professionals, and <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.washingtonpost.com/health/shortages-confusion-and-poor-communication-complicate-coronavirus-preparations/2020/02/25/d9e56396-575d-11ea-9b35-def5a027d470_story.html__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CGrR4aZaQ%24\">hospitals</a> are running out. Those in the medical field, Cowen says, \"are the ones willing to pay the most,\" and higher prices might cut down on frivolous buying by the general public. Higher prices are also a signal to manufacturers to make more masks.  </p>", "<p>There are obviously downsides to higher prices. Merchants are profiteering on fear, and higher prices mean only the more affluent can afford masks. \"There is a genuine, legitimate fairness concern,\" Cowen says.  </p>", "<p>A <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/consumer.findlaw.com/consumer-transactions/price-gouging-laws-by-state.html__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CEKDHvdSg%24\">majority of states</a> around the country have laws against price gouging. California's, for example, forbids raising prices by <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/oag.ca.gov/consumers/pricegougingduringdisasters__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CFWhWD3lg%24\">more than ten percent </a>if the governor has declared an emergency. We found no reports yet of these laws being applied to masks. According to most economists, setting a ceiling on mask prices would only add to the problem: \"If you keep the price artificially low, there ends up being a shortage, not enough in the market,\" says Cowen.  </p>", "<p>It's not just politicians who are concerned about the optics of price gouging. Amazon, for example, has a policy urging \"fair pricing.\" In recent weeks, <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-coronavirus-face-mask-price-gouging-shortages/__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CFzvZrXpw%24\">it's told </a>some sellers of masks on its marketplace that they could be suspended if they jack up their prices too much. \"There is no place for price gouging on Amazon,\" says a company spokesperson. \"We are disappointed that bad actors are attempting to artificially raise prices on basic need products during a global health crisis and, in line with our long-standing policy, have recently blocked or removed tens of thousands of offers.\" </p>", "<p>Amazon's policy might seem strange, considering it's a profit-hungry corporation that <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.propublica.org/article/amazon-says-it-puts-customers-first-but-its-pricing-algorithm-doesnt__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CHNioMQrA%24\">uses fancy algorithms</a> to increase prices all the time. But <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Justice/Kahneman.pdf__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CFYywhoig%24\">a famous study </a>by Daniel Kahneman, Jack Knetsch, and Richard Thaler suggests profiteering during a calamity could hurt a company's bottom line if it results in long-lasting damage to their reputation. \"Uber learned this the hard way,\" Thaler says, pointing to <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/business.financialpost.com/business-insider/how-a-hurricane-sandy-related-pr-nightmare-cost-startup-uber-100000-in-one-day__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CEudrH6_Q%24\">the PR damage</a> inflicted by its use of surge pricing during Hurricane Sandy.  </p>", "<p>\"Amazon doesn't want people to resent it,\" Cowen says. \"Masks are a very small share of their overall business, but if people get upset at Amazon, the whole company could be worth less.\" In other words, Amazon has an economic interest in not appearing cold-hearted in times like this. For Cowen, the solution to the mask shortage is letting the market set the price. \"Arguably, it would be better for the country and the world to let the price of the masks go higher.

Because of their disabilities, these borrowers qualify to have their federal student loans erased. But one letter, signed by more than 30 advocacy groups, says the department has made the application process so burdensome that most borrowers never get the help they're entitled to.</p>", "<p>A second letter, signed by the student loan advocates of seven states and the District of Columbia, similarly urges the department to clear away unnecessary administrative hurdles and to automatically discharge the loans of all eligible borrowers with permanent disabilities.</p>", "<p>In a statement to NPR, Education Department Press Secretary Angela Morabito suggested the department is open to change: </p>", "<p>\"The Department's current implementing regulations require it to receive an application before completing a civilian [total and permanent disability] discharge, but we are interested in providing automatic discharge to these borrowers and believe the FUTURE Act makes this a possibility \u2014 but will require the department to undergo negotiated rulemaking.\" </p>", "<p>The letters come after an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/12/04/776058798/why-student-loan-borrowers-with-disabilities-arent-getting-the-help-they-deserve\">NPR investigation</a> revealed that only 28% of eligible borrowers with disabilities \u2014 identified by the Education Department between March 2016 and September 2019 \u2014 have either had their loans erased or are on track for that to happen.</p>", "<p>\"That number is unacceptable. Twenty-eight percent is a shockingly low number,\" says Alex Elson, senior counsel at the National Student Legal Defense Network, one of the advocacy groups pushing DeVos to make improvements.</p>", "<p>For more than half a century, student loan borrowers with a significant, permanent disability have been protected by federal law: If they can no longer work enough to support themselves or repay their debts, they can have their federal student loans erased.</p>", "<p>The Education Department currently requires that eligible borrowers <em>apply</em> for help, but Tuesday's letters argue that the application process is unnecessary. In 2015, the U.S. government began comparing the Social Security Administration's records of Americans who have <a href=\"https://www.disability-benefits-help.org/glossary/medical-improvement-not-expected\">total, permanent disabilities</a> to the Education Department's database of federal student borrowers. It then made a list of everyone whose name appeared in both.</p>", "<p>According to department data obtained by NPR, between March 2016 and September 2019, 555,000 borrowers with significant, permanent disabilities were identified as eligible for loan discharge. While the department attempted to notify many of them of their eligibility, ultimately, just 200,000 successfully applied to have their loans conditionally discharged and proceeded to the burdensome income-monitoring period. As of December 2019, only 156,000 borrowers have either had their loans erased or are still on track for that to happen.</p>", "<p>\"The application process is standing in the way of critical relief for hundreds of thousands of eligible borrowers, thwarting the intent of Congress that their student loan debt be discharged,\" says the letter signed by advocacy groups including the American Federation of Teachers, the National Disability Rights Network and Easterseals.</p>", "<p>Both letters recommend the same fix: Automatically discharge the federal student loans of every eligible borrower who has met the federal government's disability standard for criteria known as <a href=\"https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0426525045\">Medical Improvement Not Expected</a>. In short, they argue, don't make these vulnerable borrowers apply for a benefit that the federal government already knows they qualify for.</p>", "<p>\"Getting to the post office can be cumbersome. Not everyone has a printer at home. These documents can be cumbersome,\" says New York state student advocate Winston Berkman-Breen, who cosigned one of the letters. \"Putting in this application has a series of really difficult and high hurdles for someone who qualifies for the program. You know, it's sort of this perverse idea that the people who are intended to benefit from the program are the ones who are least able to access the program.\"</p>", "<p>In December, in response to NPR's findings, an Education Department official told NPR the department had made incremental improvements to the application process since 2016: \"We continue to look for ways to make the process easier to navigate for disabled student loan borrowers, while maintaining the integrity of the taxpayer dollars associated with the discharges.\"</p>", "<p>Multiple legal and policy experts say if the department is genuinely interested in making these changes, it can. </p>", "<p>\"They have the authority to do this. The laws and programs already exist,\" says Washington state student loan advocate Stephanie Sampedro, who cosigned one of the letters. \"[The Education Department] has already done it for some borrowers \u2014 for veterans who are disabled.\"</p>", "<p>In August 2019, President Trump and DeVos announced that eligible veterans with permanent disabilities would begin to have their loans discharged <em>automatically</em>. They would no longer need to respond to a letter or ask for help.</p>", "<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-discharging-federal-student-loan-debt-totally-permanently-disabled-veterans/\">presidential memorandum</a> announcing the move, Trump offered a scathing critique of the discharge process, saying it is \"overly complicated and difficult, and prevented too many of our veterans from receiving the relief for which they are eligible. This has inflicted significant hardship and serious harm on these veterans and has frustrated the intent of the Congress that their Federal student loan debt be discharged.\"</p>", "<p>The president's move was widely celebrated, but it has so far done nothing for the far larger group of <em>civilians</em> with permanent disabilities who are also legally entitled to the same loan discharge.</p>", "<p>\"And now it's time for [the Department] to grant the same relief to civilians who, through no fault of their own, became totally and permanently disabled and are now struggling to repay their debts,\" Sampedro says.</p>", "<p>For the past two years, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers has <a href=\"https://www.coons.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/%5bUntitled%5d1.pdf\">similarly urged</a> DeVos to automatically discharge the loans of all eligible borrowers with permanent disabilities.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

The suit maintains that the final report \"concluded there was no conspiracy between the [2016] Campaign and the Russian government, and no United States person intentionally coordinated with Russia's efforts.\"</p>", "<p>The Mueller report did say it \"did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in the election interference activities.\" But it also concluded that \"the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.\"</p>", "<p>First Amendment scholars tell NPR that prominent public officials must meet a tough legal standard to win defamation cases, especially those involving opinion pieces. That's even more true for the nation's chief executive, who is expected to be subject to widespread public criticism and scrutiny. </p>", "<p>However, publications can be held liable for incorrect statements of fact made within opinion columns in which publishers are believed to have acted with \"reckless disregard\" or \"actual malice\" as defined under the law. <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> is still defending itself in a defamation suit by former Alaska Gov.
