But the state\u2019s most recent budget tweaked that formula. </p>", "<p>Counties now have the option to reduce by as much as 50% the number of workers at polling places where voters from multiple precincts use a single facility, provided that location is equipped with electronic pollbooks, an automated replacement for paper registries to sign in voters. </p>", "<p>But unforeseen disruptors such as the coronavirus underscore why it is important to staff polling locations robustly, said Catherine Turcer, executive director of the Ohio branch of Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog group. </p>", "<p>\u201cIf we have a reduction in poll workers plus people calling off sick, it could be really problematic,\u201d Turcer said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it makes sense to have more poll workers than you really need.\u201d </p>", "<p>A spokesman for Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose noted that at least three members of any county\u2019s election board - each run by two Democratic and two Republican members - must approve any reductions.\u00a0 </p>", "<p>\u201cThe Secretary does not have the authority to overrule the board\u2019s decision,\u201d wrote the spokesman in an email. </p>", "<p>The Secretary of State\u2019s office did not respond to a request for further comment.  </p>", "<p>The planned reductions represent a modest 3.4% decline in overall poll workers statewide compared to past elections.

They note that Ohioans can vote early in person, or by mail starting 28 days before an election, innovations that have thinned crowds on Election Day. </p>", "<p>The Ohio Association of Election Officials has pushed the state legislature to let counties reduce staffing at polling locations since 2015. Ockerman said the lower poll worker requirements could enable counties to remain compliant with the law even if they lose part of their workforces due to coronavirus concerns.  </p>", "<p>But voter advocates say the drop in poll workers could make Ohio the next major state where new election laws and procedures result in long lines for Democratic voters, as they did in the Texas and California primaries on Super Tuesday. </p>", "<p>Ohio\u2019s primary comes at a pivotal time in the race to determine whether U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders or former Vice President Joe Biden will be the Democratic presidential nominee in November. </p>", "<p>\u201cPoll workers are really the frontline for making sure our election system works,\u201d said Jen Miller, executive director of the Ohio League of Women Voters. </p>", "<p>Registered Republicans make up a majority of voters in all 20 Ohio counties that reduced poll workers.
