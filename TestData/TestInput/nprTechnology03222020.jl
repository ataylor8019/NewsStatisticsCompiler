Now the government is carrying out cellphone surveillance of people who may have come into contact with the virus.</p>", "<p>Hundreds of Israelis were startled Wednesday by an unsolicited text message.</p>", "<p>\"Hello. According to an epidemiological investigation,\" it began, addressing each recipient by name. \"You were near someone sick with the coronavirus. You must immediately isolate at home [14 days] to protect your relatives and the public. ... This information will be used only for this purpose and will be erased when no longer needed. Sincerely, public health services.\"</p>", "<p>It's part of a sweeping new program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the country's Shin Bet domestic spy agency, usually tasked with monitoring Palestinian and Israeli extremists, to launch the cellphone surveillance. It locates people who could have the virus and messages them.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, late Thursday Israel's Supreme Court stopped the police from using the data to enforce quarantines, which it had started doing. The court also said it could scrap the program unless it goes through parliament or if the country is put on a total lockdown.</p>", "<p>The court order appeared to be written before the government required people to stay at home, with some exceptions, late Thursday. It's unclear how that will affect the future of the surveillance program.</p>", "<p>With more than 600 cases and tens of thousands quarantined, the country has closed all schools, restaurants and entertainment venues.</p>", "<p>The moves come as Netanyahu struggles to stay in power after an election March 2, which has so far failed to produce a winner. The opposition leader is trying to gather the votes in parliament to unseat him.</p>", "<p>Small protests broke out Thursday \u2014 in defiance of emergency rules against gatherings \u2014 after the speaker of the parliament, a Netanyahu ally, shut down the chamber until next week. Police broke up the crowds.</p>", "<p>The phone surveillance has added to the fears among some about the country's democracy.</p>", "<p>\"Big Brother is here,\" wrote Omer, a young father, on Facebook, minutes after he received a text message that he'd been close to a virus carrier the previous week.</p>", "<p>\"I guess I can understand why they're doing it,\" he said in an interview, withholding his last name due to, well, privacy concerns. \"But it makes you think what other private personal information they have access to, and if it's being used in the appropriate way.\"</p>", "<p>Michal Rudnik, 22, was recently driving her ill 20-year-old brother to the doctor when a police car pulled up next to her at a gas station in the southern Israeli town of Meitar. She was driving her father's car, and her parents are in quarantine after returning from a trip to London. </p>", "<p>\"The policeman asked me, 'Who is in the back seat?' So I said, 'It's my brother.' And he said, 'OK, I thought it was your father, who's supposed to be in quarantine.' And I was like, 'No, no, it's my brother.' \"</p>", "<p>She said the officer followed up by naming her father and asking if he was sticking to the quarantine. \"I was in shock,\" Rudnik said. \"I guess in a way it's also the right thing to do, but it wasn't a good feeling.\"</p>", "<p>The country's Health Ministry had already been publicizing the dates and times people with the virus had visited any locations, based on interviews. Now, officials use cellphone tracking going back two weeks and send the text messages to people who crossed paths with the virus.</p>", "<p>Netanyahu's Cabinet approved the surveillance measures in the middle of the night Monday, circumventing a parliamentary oversight committee still debating whether they were justified.</p>", "<p>The Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians said a lack of transparency about the surveillance program hurt public trust. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel was among several groups that petitioned Israel's Supreme Court Thursday to demand an end to the surveillance program.</p>", "<p>\"I think that people in Israel in general are willing to limit their right of privacy to combat terrorism \u2014 Palestinians or other enemies,\" said Gil Gan-Mor, an attorney with the civil rights group. \"Now people find out that the Shin Bet and the police know exactly where they are in any second. People are awakening and understanding the problem of giving too much power to the government when it comes to our privacy.\"</p>", "<p>It's likely that Israelis who were not within 2 meters (6 feet) of distance from a virus carrier will still be identified for quarantine.<a href=\"http://www.cellex.co.il/\"> Sharon Perry</a>, a cellular tracing expert, said the GPS technology of civilian mobiles can pinpoint a person's location only within 5 to 6 meters' accuracy if the cellphone is outdoors, or 10 to 20 meters if the phone is indoors. But he argued the breach of privacy was justified.</p>", "<p>\"In any case that someone can trace your route and location you should be concerned, but I guess that when you have a global pandemic happening in the world, there is a kind of justification for this move,\" Perry said.</p>", "<p>Alon Hazay, a cybersecurity expert who used to do work for a national cyberdefense initiative connected to Shin Bet intelligence, said the trove of cellphone location data could get into the hands of hackers, private investigators or criminal organizations. \"When the data is out there then other parties can try to take advantage and misuse this information, and create a huge problem for privacy of the citizens of Israel,\" Hazay said.</p>", "<p>Anti-Netanyahu lawmakers \u2014 who are a slim majority in parliament following this month's election \u2014 accuse caretaker Prime Minister Netanyahu of exploiting the coronavirus to barricade himself in office, harming Israel's democratic institutions.</p>", "<p>Netanyahu faces charges of bribery and fraud and his trial was supposed to start this week. But his justice minister closed down the courts, leading judges to postpone the trial.</p>", "<p>Netanyahu said he requires maximum oversight for the surveillance program to protect Israelis' private data.</p>", "<p>\"While I'm fighting the coronavirus war to save Israeli lives, giving my soul day and night, the opposition is trying to topple the prime minister who is navigating the boat during the corona storm,\" he said in an interview to Israeli Channel 12 TV.</p>", "<p><em>Sami Sockol contributed reporting.</em></p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

The games offer a solution to some who are looking for a way to hang out with friends and family \u2014 while upholding the guidelines on social distancing, including orders to stay at home.</p>", "<p>Jackbox Games is a Chicago-based video game company that makes party games, including the trivia game <em>You Don't Know Jack</em>. Its games are designed for people in a room to play together.</p>", "<p>Last weekend, Jackbox saw traffic \"comparable to Thanksgiving weekend, which is a very busy time of year for us,\" according to CEO Mike Bilder. \"Across the board we've just seen a lot of additional activity over a typical weekend.\"</p>", "<p>Bilder says that part of that uptick is people staying at home and enjoying indoor activities together. But others are using the games in non-traditional ways, using streaming software to play together virtually. Last week, Jackbox published <a href=\"https://jackboxgames.com/how-to-play-jackbox-games-with-friends-and-family-remotely/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=remoteguide&amp;utm_campaign=remoteguide&amp;utm_content=remoteguide\">a guide</a> to playing remotely with friends and family, using Skype, Zoom or Google Hangouts.</p>", "<p>Many gamers use the free voice app <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/\">Discord </a>to talk to each other while playing online together. The company says its account sign-ups are up 200% over last week \u2014 though Discord notes that not all sign-ups are necessarily for gaming, as the app can also be used for distance learning, among other things.</p>", "<p>LingLing Lau, 34, is one of those who is moving her gaming online as her normal life is upended. She lives in Chicago and usually meets up with friends every Wednesday to play the five-on-five arcade game <a href=\"https://killerqueenarcade.com/\">Killer Queen</a>.</p>", "<p>\"Before all this, most of my time that I spent gaming was playing at the arcade with people,\" Lau says. \"I'm definitely very extroverted, so it's hard to not be able to see your friends face-to-face and hang out with them.\"</p>", "<p>In recent days, Lau and her friends have been meeting up virtually to play Jackbox games. The games lend themselves to playing remotely, she says, because only one person needs to own the game. She can launch it from her computer, stream it on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch</a>, then share the stream so her friends can play along on their phones.</p>", "<p>She says that social distancing has motivated her and her friends to be more proactive about staying in touch and planning evenings to play games together virtually.</p>", "<p>\"It's certainly not the same as being able to see people in person,\" Lau says. \"But I think for me it's been nice. It's brought some lightness to this whole situation.\"</p>", "<p>Game developers are adapting, too \u2014 even changing game rules to cater to the new reality of people staying at home.</p>", "<p>Niantic, Inc. makes the popular games <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go</em> and <em>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</em>. Both games usually reward players for leaving home and walking around to collect virtual items.</p>", "<p>But last week Niantic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NianticHelp/status/1238605977278013440\">announced</a> it was eliminating walking requirements in its battle games. It also made it easier for players to collect virtual items in their own homes, rather than out in the world.</p>", "<p>That's been a boon to Daysha Lawrence, 41, of North Canton, Ohio. A faculty member at the local community college, Lawrence is now working remotely and her 8-year-old son Maxwell is home from school. During breaks they'll play <em>Minecraft </em>or <em>Harry Potter</em> together \u2014 and it's easier now that the rule changes allow them to stay indoors.</p>", "<p>In the past, they would go to the park to collect items for the Harry Potter game \u2014 but now the ingredients they need to make virtual potions are found in their house.</p>", "<p>\"They're making it so that we're able to access a lot of the same features of the game as we are trying to practice social distancing and isolating ourselves,\" Lawrence says.</p>", "<p>Some serious gamers say that these homebound times are changing which games they feel like playing.</p>", "<p>Kat Safreed, 24, and Ryan Childers, 26, live in Somerville, Mass. They got married eight months ago, and both are now working from home due to the coronavirus. \"We've lived together for three years, but I don't think we've ever spent this much time together,\" Safreed says, laughing.</p>", "<p>Childers likes to play in-depth strategy games like <em>Gary Grigsby's War in the Pacific.</em> He says that he's found himself seeking out multiplayer online games that involve more social interaction rather than ones where you play alone.</p>", "<p>\"The games I play are like an hour-long match,\" he says. \"You have enough time to get to know people, you work together as a team. You're getting shot at. You're yelling at each other because you're getting shot at and you don't know where you're getting shot at from. It it gives you enough time to kind of develop good relationships with people and then you move into the next match and you're all on the same team again, so you get the same squad because you know each other and and so on. It's both casual and not.\"</p>", "<p>Safreed's tastes are very different \u2014 she prefers <em>The Sims</em> and <em>Pok\u00e9mon</em>. Her favorite is <em>Animal Crossing</em>, a game for Nintendo Switch.</p>", "<p>\"It's kind of escapism,\" she says. \"Right now things are really scary and I just can't wait to go onto an island and be in debt to a raccoon, and not have coronavirus. I can make my island whatever I want it to be. I can have all my villagers and they're all nice. It's just very idealistic.\"</p>", "<p>The couple regularly plays the board game Dungeons &amp; Dragons with a group of friends. But this week they're going to try playing it online together.</p>", "<p>\"We are a little bit nervous about how that is actually going to work out when we can't kind of keep everyone calm and in control, but I think it will be fun,\" says Safreed. And it's fine if their D&amp;D game doesn't translate perfectly online.</p>", "<p>\"The most important thing,\" she says, is \"we're still talking to each other and checking in on each other after a stressful week.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

During that year, influence specialists used fake accounts across social media to spread disinformation and amplify discord.</p>", "<p>That work never really stopped, national security officials have said, and officials warned ahead of Super Tuesday's primaries that <a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/liveblogs/20200303-super-tuesday/share/voting-disrupted-in-tennessee-51.html\">it continues at a comparatively low but steady state</a>.</p>", "<p>Roth told NPR that while Twitter has not traced specific tweets about the 2020 campaign back to Russia, it is trying to apply what it learned from the last presidential race, including about the use of fake personae.</p>", "<p>\"These would be accounts that were pretending to be Americans to try and influence certain parts of the conversation,\" Roth said in an interview with NPR's Ari Shapiro.</p>", "<p>While this tactic has remained a part of Russia's toolkit, the playbook also has continued to expand.</p>", "<p>In 2018, Russia didn't just interfere in the election, influence-mongers tried to make it look like there was more interference than there actually was.</p>", "<p>\"We saw activity that we believe to have been connected with the Russian Internet Research Agency that was specifically targeting journalists in an attempt to convince them that there had been large scale activity on the platform that didn't actually happen,\" Roth said.</p>", "<p>This time around, rather than create its own messaging, Russia and other foreign actors are amplifying the voices of real Americans, Roth said. By re-sharing extreme \u2014 albeit authentic content \u2014 they're able to manipulate the platform without introducing any additional misinformation.</p>", "<p>\"I think in 2020, we're facing a particularly divisive political moment here in the United States and attempts to capitalize on those divisions among Americans seem to be where malicious actors are heading,\" Roth said.</p>", "<p>The social network has studied fake accounts and coordinated manipulation efforts and have put its new policies to the test during elections in the European Union and India.</p>", "<p>Roth says Twitter has also built a community of experts, including community moderators and partners in government and academia. Another priority is transparency.</p>", "<p>When the platform uncovers \"state-backed information operations\" it <a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/en_us/advocacy/elections-integrity.html#data\">shares the information publicly</a>.</p>", "<p>\n                Twitter feeds will start to look different as the social network begins flagging posts that it thinks are part of broad deception campaigns.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/AP\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Twitter feeds will start to look different as the social network begins flagging posts that it thinks are part of broad deception campaigns.</p>", "<p><strong>Weaponizing deception</strong></p>", "<p>Foreign actors aren't the only ones likely to be impacted by this new policy. Misinformation can also come from American political campaigns trying to use social media to their advantage.</p>", "<p>Roth says he's already seen American 2020 candidates employ questionable tactics to get voters' attention.</p>", "<p>\"We've seen ... accounts that are pretending to be compromised. So they'll sort of pretend that they were hacked and then share content that they might otherwise not have,\" Roth said, along with \"large scale attempts to mobilize volunteers to share content on the service.\"</p>", "<p>While neither of these actions necessarily violate Twitter's policies, there are moments where they can cross the line.</p>", "<p>For example, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign hired hundreds of temporary employees to post campaign messages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.</p>", "<p>Twitter decided to suspend dozens of these pro-Bloomberg accounts. Roth says their decision was not based on the fact that these individuals were being paid to post content.</p>", "<p>\"Our focus whenever we're enforcing our policies is to look at the behavior that the accounts are engaged in, not who we think is behind them or what their motivations were, because in most instances we don't know,\" Roth said.</p>", "<p>Twitter determined that the suspended accounts were \"engaged in spam.\"</p>", "<p>If a large number of people organically decide to post the same message or similar messages at the same time, that isn't likely to qualify as spam, Roth said.</p>", "<p>But if individual users create multiple accounts just for the purpose of tweeting a specific message, then it does. They're over amplifying their voice in a way that constitutes manipulation.</p>", "<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/21/797101409/npr-poll-majority-of-americans-believe-trump-encourages-election-interference\">an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll</a>, 82 percent of Americans think they will read misleading information on social media this election. Three quarters said they don't trust tech companies to prevent their platforms from being misused for election interference.</p>", "<p>Roth said the investments Twitter has made since 2018 to protect the \"integrity of the platform\" and ensure the security of its users has been significant \u2014 but he called that a balancing act.</p>", "<p>This is why Twitter's new policy doesn't remove all manipulated content. To combat false information, Roth says Twitter is trying to highlight information from trustworthy sources.</p>", "<p>For example, while Twitter isn't removing all false information regarding the coronavirus, it's making sure that information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is displayed prominently.</p>", "<p>\"I think a platform has a responsibility to create a space where credible voices can reach audiences that are interested in understanding what they have to say,\" Roth said. </p>", "<p>\"That doesn't mean that we don't allow discussion of these issues throughout the product, but we want to ensure that when you first come to Twitter at the information that you see in our product is going to come from authoritative sources.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

It's just one of the ways that performers and organizations worldwide are grappling with the uncertainties of the coronavirus, and how to handle large gatherings of audiences in close quarters.</p>", "<p>The Western classical music industry is now heavily reliant upon East Asia, and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/07/07/symphony-of-millions\">specifically China</a>, as crucial consumer markets. In recent weeks, the <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/boston-symphony-cancels-asia-tour-amid-china-virus-outbreak/2069720/\">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> has cancelled a tour of Asia and Washington, D.C.'s National Symphony Orchestra has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/national-symphony-orchestra-cancels-china-concerts-due-to-coronavirus-outbreak/2020/02/04/2eca06b4-4778-11ea-8124-0ca81effcdfb_story.html\">cancelled three concerts in China</a>. New York's famed Juilliard School, which is scheduled to open a satellite conservatory in Tianjin, China this autumn, announced at the end of January that it has <a href=\"https://www.tianjinjuilliard.edu.cn/news/2020/01/message-tianjin-juilliard-school-precautionary-measures-response-novel-coronavirus/\">suspended</a> all in-person auditions and other admissions-related activities in China and Asia indefinitely.</p>", "<p>The list of American musicians and institutions who have already canceled tours or postponed other activities due to coronavirus concerns covers a broad range, including <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/02/green-day-coronavirus-cancel-tour-bts-1202870666/\">Green Day</a> and <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/coronavirus-american-singer-khalid-postpones-singapore-concert\">Khalid</a>. Even more directly affected are Asian and European musicians who can't perform in their home markets, like the megastar K-pop band <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-southkorea-cases/south-korea-coronavirus-cases-surge-to-2337-bts-cancel-gigs-idUSKCN20M047\">BTS</a> \u2014 who have canceled April dates in their home city of Seoul. In Japan, prime minister Shinzo Abe made a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/japan-schools-coronavirus.html\">request</a> on Feb. 26 that all large cultural and sports events be postponed or canceled across the country; the wide-ranging Hong Kong Arts Festival, which was supposed to take place across February and March with performers from all over the world, was <a href=\"https://www.hk.artsfestival.org/en/\">canceled</a> entirely. </p>", "<p>Similarly, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra canceled all of its performances for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShanghaiSO/status/1223589284344664064?s=20\">February</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShanghaiSO/status/1230800366121496578?s=20\">March</a> due to the health crisis; its musicians have been posting concerts, master classes and audio programs <a href=\"http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/28/WS5e585350a31012821727aeab_1.html\">online</a>, in part to help locals beat the tedium of being quarantined. In Italy, Milan's famed La Scala opera house has <a href=\"http://www.teatroallascala.org/en/coronavirus.html\">canceled</a> a range of upcoming performances, including one featuring conductor Zubin Mehta and the Richard Strauss opera <em>Salome</em>.</p>", "<p>The global reach and frenetic pace of contemporary artists' careers is having an effect as well. Earlier this week, New York's Metropolitan Opera requested that all visiting artists who are arriving from countries already deeply affected by the COVID-19 outbreak \u2014 including Italy, China and South Korea \u2014 to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in New York before beginning rehearsals at the house. </p>", "<p>One of the biggest annual K-pop events in the U.S., a concert sponsored by the Korea Times Media Group that was supposed to feature at least a dozen Korean music acts and which was scheduled to take place at the Hollywood Bowl on Apr. 25, has been <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/02/korea-times-music-festival-postponed-coronavirus-hollywood-bowl-travel-restrictions-1202868776/\">postponed indefinitely</a>.</p>", "<p>But cities that host large-scale music and entertainment gatherings are loathe to cancel events that can be big economic drivers \u2014 and event organizers and local government officials are grappling with those decisions very publicly.</p>", "<p>For example, on Tuesday afternoon, Miami mayor Carlos Gim\u00e9nez wrote on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayorGimenez/status/1234891029549113345?s=20\">Twitter</a>: \"We're not canceling any major events in Miami-Dade County, such as Ultra, following the guidance from Florida's surgeon general on #coronavirus.\" He was referring to the popular, annual Ultra Music Festival, which is scheduled for March 20 to 22, and which last year drew about 170,000 EDM fans. By Wednesday, however, the organizers' thinking seemed to evolve, and Ultra is, according to the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/downtown-miami/article240878956.html\"><em>Miami Herald</em></a>, on the brink of being canceled. (As of publishing time, Ultra had not made an official announcement.) Strikingly, a sister event in the United Arab Emirates \u2014 <a href=\"https://ultra-abudhabi.com/ticket-notice/\">Ultra Abu Dhabi</a>, which was scheduled to take place this Thursday and Friday \u2014 had already been canceled due to <a href=\"https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/coronavirus-ultra-abu-dhabi-music-festival-postponed-1.987193\">coronavirus concerns</a>.</p>", "<p>The annual SXSW conference and festivals in Austin, Texas, encompasses technology,  music and film \u2014 and drew over <a href=\"https://explore.sxsw.com/hubfs/2019-SXSW-Event-Stats_9-10-19.pdf?__hstc=66818801.ae0172ed30b12e03d08bf94f6e0cd022.1578934127416.1583336287233.1583339780423.11&amp;__hssc=66818801.3.1583339780423\">417,000 attendees</a> in 2019, according to organizers' estimates. They say that this year's events, scheduled for March 13 to 22, are still on. (In past years, NPR Music has had a significant presence at SXSW, and as of publication, a range of NPR journalists and employees are scheduled to participate this year as well.)</p>", "<p>On Monday, the organizers put out a statement saying, \"SXSW is working closely on a <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/covid-19-attendee-information/\">daily basis</a> with local, state, and federal agencies to plan for a safe event. ... The health of the Austin community and those who visit our city is our highest priority.\" At a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAnAd0QH8KU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">press conference</a> on March 4, Austin Public Health's Dr. Mark Escott said, \"There is no evidence that closing SXSW or other activities is going to make the community safer.\" Later in his comments, Escott said, \"One of the concerns is if we shut down \u2014 or make the recommendation to shut down \u2014 SXSW, people will still continue to come here. They will travel, they will still do what they were going to do, but without that organizational structure that SXSW provides.\"</p>", "<p>Nevertheless, an online <a href=\"http://www.change.org/p/petition-to-have-sxsw-cancelled-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">petition</a> asking SXSW to cancel this year's event has, as of Thursday afternoon, attracted more than 50,000 signatures. And a number of prominent tech and media companies \u2014 including <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/02/texas-coronavirus-fears-rise-sxsw-marches/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/facebook-joins-twitter-skipping-sxsw-coronavirus-concerns-1282229\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kxan.com/news/coronavirus/facebook-intel-join-twitter-in-pulling-out-of-sxsw-over-coronavirus-fears/\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-and-vevo-cancel-sxsw-plans-amid-coronavirus-fears/2241951\">Vevo</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mashable/status/1234878736832647172?s=20\">Mashable</a>, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/amazon-studios-cancels-sxsw-coronavirus-1203523420/\">Amazon Studios</a>, <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/digital/tiktok-drops-sxsw-appearances-coronavirus-fears-continue-disrupt-festival/2242126\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/netflix-cancels-sxsw-2020-1203524545/\">Netflix</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNNPR/status/1235588096399265793?s=20\">WarnerMedia</a> (which owns CNN and HBO, among other properties) \u2014 have all decided to withdraw from SXSW this year, due to coronavirus fears.</p>", "<p>So have some notable individual speakers, including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and best-selling author Tim Ferriss. On Twitter, Ferriss <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1234860126756012039?s=20\">explained</a> his decision: \"I love SXSW, but I don't believe the novel coronavirus can be contained, and I view an int'l event of 100K+ people as a huge risk to attendees and the entire city, given limited ICU beds, etc. I implore [Austin mayor Steve] Adler and his team to carefully evaluate the downsides. SXSW brings huge economic benefit to Austin, but possibly making Austin a hotspot for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, and the emergency actions and funding that would require, could make a huge event seem shortsighted.\"</p>", "<p>SXSW is downplaying those absences, however \u2014 and in recent days, event organizers have announced a <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/news/2020/tamron-hall-kumail-nanjiani-chris-evans-emily-v-gordon-join-sxsw-2020/\">starry array</a> of speakers added to its lineup, including Hillary Clinton, Rep. Adam Schiff, Katie Couric and RZA.</p>", "<p>On a \"<a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/covid-19-attendee-information/\">COVID-19 attendee information</a>\" page last updated on Monday, the organizers say: \"At this time, there are a handful of cancellations from participants who were traveling from China and Japan and there have been a few corporate travel bans. Other than that, the cancellations are on par from past years.\"</p>", "<p>Undeniably, the event provides a massive economic boost to Austin each year \u2014 according to its own most recent analysis, SXSW was worth nearly <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Press-Release-SXSW-Economic-Impact-2019.pdf\">$356 million</a> to the city in 2019.</p>", "<p>Audience members who have already purchased SXSW passes but who are now uncertain that they want to attend \u2014 or who are being curtailed from traveling to the United States \u2014 seem to be out of luck. According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/criativo/status/1233859651386642435?s=20\">social media posts</a>, individuals who have requested refunds or deferrals to the 2021 edition due to coronavirus issues are being told that their 2020 tickets are nonrefundable. NPR reached out repeatedly to SXSW for comment, but organizers did not respond.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

And: \"One notable trend is the increase in the discussion of feminism at both ends of the spectrum.\"</p>", "<p>Kim's findings about the posts' focus on nonwhites tracks with earlier findings of former special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, both of which documented clear attempts by Russian influence-mongers specifically to divide blacks or dissuade them from voting.</p>", "<p>Kim's findings also suggested a level of political sophistication about the operations she analyzed: The accounts targeted battleground states, including those expected to be critical in 2020, such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Ohio and Arizona.</p>", "<p><strong>Move versus countermove</strong></p>", "<p>For as much continuity as Kim's research uncovered about more recent influence operations, the overall game is different from 2016.</p>", "<p>National security officials and social media platforms are working in real time to monitor and counter election interference in a way they didn't during the last presidential race.</p>", "<p>Twitter's head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811686225/twitter-vows-that-as-disinformation-tactics-change-its-policies-will-keep-pace?live=1\">acknowledged to NPR this week</a> that the service was caught \"flat-footed\" last time and that this is why it's being more active for the 2020 race.</p>", "<p>At the same time, however, Roth said technical aspects of the influence operations are changing too.</p>", "<p>Twitter today traces very few election-interference posts to Russia, he said.

No. But I think given where we are, I think this is a useful set of tools that if used in the right hands could be effective.\"</p>", "<p>Here is a Q&amp;A about the law that Trump has invoked:</p>", "<p><strong>What exactly is the Defense Production Act, or DPA?<br></strong><br>The DPA is a law that has its origins in the <a href=\"https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/exhibitions/artifact/hr-6233-bill-expedite-prosecution-war-effort-first-war-powers-act-december-15\">War</a> Powers <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2014/title-50/appendix-50/second-war-powers-act-1942\">Acts </a>of World War II, which granted the executive branch broad powers to direct industrial production for the war effort. Those authorities were allowed to expire when the war was over, but in 1950, after Soviet-backed North Korea invaded South Korea, President Harry Truman revived those lapsed powers by persuading Congress to enact the DPA.</p>", "<p><strong>But this is not a war \u2014 this is a health crisis. How does the DPA relate to the coronavirus pandemic?<br></strong><br>The law contains a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/4511\">section </a>that authorizes the president to control the production and distribution of scarce materials deemed \"essential to the national defense.\" In his executive order, Trump specifically cites protective equipment (presumably face masks) and ventilators as meeting the criteria in this provision.</p>", "<p><strong>How do the broad authorities in the DPA work for stepping up industrial production?<br></strong><br>The U.S. government is able to make contracts with industry under the law prioritizing the production of goods in scarce supply. It can also provide loan guarantees or lend money directly to targeted industries, and it can <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/defense-production-act-program\">shield them</a> from anti-trust actions resulting from firms cooperating and planning with one another. And if those incentives prove insufficient, administration officials can also <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/4511\">use</a> what's called an \"allocation authority\" \u2014 namely, telling firms that the government has the right to purchase their products above anyone else.</p>", "<p>\"You could use the prospect of these things to get them to agree to what you want to do \u2014 it's a sword of Damocles authority, if you will,\" says Bialos. \"Fundamentally, this is a set of tools the administration can use to negotiate with companies in an industry. So if you're short of some product \u2014 ventilators, face masks, whatever \u2014 you call in the company, survey their capabilities quickly, understand what they can and can't do, and then you start dealing.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Who will be in charge of implementing the DPA to boost output of masks and ventilators?<br></strong><br>In his executive order, Trump delegates his authority to carry out the law \"to the Secretary of Health and Human Services with respect to all health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States.\" HHS Secretary Alex Azar is directed to consult with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the heads of other agencies to determine \"the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of all health and medical resources, including controlling the distribution of such materials\" for responding to the coronavirus crisis.</p>", "<p><strong>What prompted Trump to invoke the DPA?<br></strong><br>Trump did not explain why he waited until now to exercise this authority to invoke the DPA. He had come under increasing fire from Congressional Democrats in recent days for not doing so. One of his critics, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., <a href=\"https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-invoking-the-defense-production-act-a-needed-step-to-ramp-up-domestic-production-of-life-saving-medical-supplies\">reacted favorably</a> to Trump's change of heart. \"Instead of saying we have 'tremendous supplies,' the Trump Administration should start coordinating with the private sector to ensure America actually has the life-saving supplies we need,\" Reed said in a statement. \"Invoking the DPA is a needed step in the right direction.\"</p>", "<p><strong>How quickly might the DPA powers spur increased output of scarce supplies?<br></strong><br>Those powers apply only to U.S. companies, wherever they operate, according to Bialos. He says this could prove problematic if those companies have foreign firms in their supply chain. And not all companies are able to quickly shift production to what the government requires. \"For a company that already makes the widget, it's easier to say, 'OK, let's put your lines to full capacity, let's repurpose your lines,' \" says Bialos. \"It gets a lot harder the less substitutable the production mix is.\"</p>", "<p>Still, Bialos expects the law will make a difference.</p>", "<p>\"I think in the short term, it's a tool to effectively squeeze and mobilize the industrial base,\" he says, \"to get the most out of it.\"</p>", "<p>He also thinks the DPA could prove useful in preparing to face the next crisis. \"We obviously need a stockpile of certain kinds of things for these pandemics that we should put in place and don't have sufficiently set up,\" notes Bialos. \"And you could use this authority to buy things to stockpile so that five, six months from now we're not in the same situation again.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Her matter-of-fact account of sexism, sexual harassment and \"unrelenting chaos\" on Uber's software teams prompted a reckoning that brought down CEO Travis Kalanick.</p>", "<p>It's easy to focus on what happened to Fowler. Her manager messaging her about sex on her <em>very first day.</em> A different manager sneakily changing her good performance review to a bad one, to block her from moving to a less-dysfunctional unit. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/2/22/14700114/is-uber-lost\">absurd episode</a> with the leather jackets.</p>", "<p>But in her new memoir, <em>Whistleblower: My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber</em>, Fowler makes a dedicated plea for you to focus, instead, on what she did about it. Again and again throughout the book, she says she wants to be the hero of her story \u2014 not the victim. Or, to use an Isaiah Berlin quote she's fond of, \"a subject, not an object.\"</p>", "<p>The memoir does provide more eyebrow-raising details about just how hostile and chaotic Uber's workplace was. But Fowler is much more interested in unpacking how \u2014 and why \u2014 she responded by going public.</p>", "<p>Her upbringing was unusual: She grew up in a large, impoverished, deeply religious family in rural Arizona and was homeschooled before becoming wholly self-taught. She calls it a wonderful childhood, full of books and music and desert adventures, but it certainly wasn't easy. As a child, she describes feeding venomous spiders to help support the family (yes, seriously), and as a teenager the lack of a structured education brought her to tears repeatedly.</p>", "<p>Fowler spends little time on her youth, which some readers may find disappointing, and aside from a partial biography of her father, she never fleshes out her siblings or parents into characters.</p>", "<p>She focuses more on college, where, in addition to starting her lifelong study of philosophy, she fell in love with physics, only to discover she was woefully unqualified for the math courses. Over intense opposition from administrators, Fowler says, she took them anyway \u2014 and, after some rocky early classes, thrived.</p>", "<p>She seemed on track for a Ph.D. in physics until what she describes as a painful and rather bizarre experience of mistreatment \u2014 one that clearly shaped her reaction to harassment at Uber. Fowler says multiple professors instructed her to set aside her research work and instead dedicate herself to monitoring and supporting another student who had threatened suicide. The administration wouldn't help her, and she faced retribution for her complaints, she says. (NPR has reached out to the university for comment.) Lawyers advised that going to court would be more misery than it was worth, so she walked away from physics.</p>", "<p>Fowler had dreamed of being an architect, then a violinist, then a philosopher or a physicist. She had never dreamed of being a software engineer. But she needed to do something, and her physics work had involved coding, so, software engineering it was. And yes, if you're keeping track at home, this means Silicon Valley was a <em>backup </em>career choice.</p>", "<p>At her first tech job, she writes, she was paid significantly less than her male co-workers. At the second, she describes an openly misogynistic boss. She hoped making the switch to Uber \u2014 a large, established company with an HR department \u2014 would pay off in better working conditions.</p>", "<p>Alas, we all know how that turned out.</p>", "<p>Fowler's occasionally eye-popping account of life at Uber ends with her making the leap to another job and reflecting seriously on her ethical obligations before deciding to speak out. In the anxious months after she went public with her story, she says she was followed and investigated by Uber goons. But the story does not end with Uber's triumphant revenge: Fowler emphasizes that she's thriving in every way possible.</p>", "<p>This memoir is a bit of a how-to book, too, with some take-home lessons for anyone discouraged by a hostile workplace.</p>", "<p>Document everything, Fowler emphasizes: Screenshots; copies; detailed notes. Complain through the proper channels, even if you know they won't work, and document your complaint. If it happens again, complain again. Do your job very well throughout (and document that, too). Know your rights. If they say you're the only one with a complaint, check if that's true. And seriously, document <em>everything. </em></p>", "<p>If none of that works? Consider what you owe the world. Read some philosophy. Or, in Fowler's case, read a <em>lot </em>of philosophy \u2014 especially the Stoics. Then decide what to do with your mountain of documentation.</p>", "<p>And while solving Uber's management issues is not Fowler's concern, she does have a word of caution for the company and its peers.</p>", "<p>Silicon Valley has caught on to the fact that it has a diversity problem. Large companies are vowing to do more to recruit women and underrepresented minorities. But Fowler bluntly says that's no solution.</p>", "<p>\"Uber didn't just need more women engineers, or more employees of color,\" she writes. \"It needed to stop breaking the law .... It didn't matter how many black engineers we hired, if they were discriminated against; it didn't matter how many women we put into positions of power, if those women perpetrated or enabled the illegal behavior.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Director James Jacoby, who worked with fellow filmmaker Anya Bourg on the project, calls the company an \"inescapable part of our modern lives.\"</p>", "<p>\"It's not just how the majority of Americans are shopping online,\" he says. \"It's also these devices in our homes. It's also the facial recognition software that's used by police departments. It's cloud computing for the government and national security establishment.\"</p>", "<p>Jacoby notes that Amazon's ubiquity \u2014 and the fact that \"so much power is pooled into the hands of one company and one man\" \u2014 raises a host of issues. The company's Echo smart speaker has been known to record \u2014 and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/25/614470096/amazon-echo-recorded-and-sent-couples-conversation-all-without-their-knowledge\">occasionally listen to</a> \u2014 the conversations of unsuspecting homeowners. In 2019, the European Union antitrust arm announced an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/17/742615426/eu-investigates-if-amazon-hurts-competition-by-using-sellers-data\">investigation</a> into Amazon's use of data collected from third-party sellers.</p>", "<p>\"I think that [<em>Atlantic </em>writer] Franklin Foer in the film puts it best, which is like everything that's amazing or awesome about Jeff Bezos and Amazon is also something to be feared about Amazon and Jeff Bezos,\" Jacoby says.</p>", "<p><strong>On why, in part, Amazon began as a bookseller</strong></p>", "<p>[Bezos] recognized very early on the power of data to predict what people would want.</p>", "<p class=\"byline\">James Jacoby</p>", "<p>Books are easy to ship. ... And [Bezos] also realized that in the online world, there would be an advantage that no single bookstore could hold all of the books in print. ... He also, I think, saw an opportunity to learn about customers through what they read. He recognized very early on the power of data to predict what people would want. So in many ways, you are what you read and you could glean a lot about a customer from what he or she reads.</p>", "<p><strong>On working conditions in Amazon warehouses </strong></p>", "<p>We spoke to dozens of current and former employees in the reporting process. The nature of the work has changed a bit over the years. When Bezos<strong> </strong>was first building out these fulfillment centers all over the country in order to deliver on the promise of delivering packages quickly, it was almost ad hoc. They were growing so quickly. And there were a lot of complaints at the time about things like heat stress. There wouldn't be the proper air conditioning in these warehouses, and people would be working like crazy to try to meet these quotas to get the packages out. People would be fainting in these warehouses. There'd be injuries.</p>", "<p>Over time, the warehouses have become much more systematized, in part because of the automation of the warehouses and buying a robot company that helped to automate things. But one thing that hasn't changed in talking to workers \u2014 both current and former \u2014 is the pace of work is incredibly grueling. You have to make rates. ... The rate essentially measures how quickly you pick and pack items. ... Every single worker we spoke to [talked about how] the rates were really high. They have a way of setting the rates for the whole warehouse \u2014 that if you don't make that rate, then you can get a write up. And if you get three write ups, then you can be fired. There's a lot of anxiety in these warehouses about making rates.</p>", "<p><strong>On a recent hack on Amazon's \"Ring\" cameras </strong></p>", "<p>Ring makes these doorbell cameras, that was their first main device. ... It's a doorbell that has a camera on it. In part, Amazon liked the idea of it, because package theft is a big deal for the company \u2014 a lot of people get packages to their door and someone's stealing that package. So now you can watch your front step. Of course, if the camera is watching the front step, it's also watching the public space on the street as well, which is somewhat problematic. So there's now this whole suite of Ring devices and Ring cameras, not just to monitor the outside of your home but also the inside of your home.</p>", "<p>There was a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/12/she-installed-ring-camera-her-childrens-room-peace-mind-hacker-accessed-it-harassed-her-year-old-daughter/?arc404=true\">recent hack</a> of indoor Ring cameras, which was rather frightful. ... There's a little girl in her room and her parents had installed a Ring camera in that room and all of a sudden there's a voice coming from the camera that's basically terrorizing her as she's alone in her room.</p>", "<p><strong>On how facial recognition software and data collection is in Amazon's hands, and is vulnerable to hacks and bad agents </strong></p>", "<p>All of this data, all of these networks \u2014 it's all up to Amazon to manage this well. And they say that that's the thing that holds them accountable, keeps them responsible on a daily basis, is that they can't breach customer trust. For a company that's built its brand on building customer trust on delivering for customers, on not breaching their trust, these sorts of hacks, these sorts of problems, are devastating to their image, because it gets customers and citizens concerned about whether we should entrust a company like Amazon with all of this. And, of course, there are safeguards in place.</p>", "<p>... some of the larger questions about Amazon are whether there are really any auditing systems, public auditing systems for cases of abuse.</p>", "<p class=\"byline\">James Jacoby</p>", "<p>But I think some of the larger questions about Amazon are whether there are really any auditing systems, public auditing systems for cases of abuse. ... We're reliant on a private company to police abuse, and there's no way to publicly audit whether they're doing a good job of that. And that's something that we asked Amazon executives about \u2014 not just about Ring cameras and Echo devices \u2014 but certainly facial recognition software, which is a very powerful tool that they have really encouraged police departments around the country to experiment with.</p>", "<p><strong>On Sen. Elizabeth Warren's idea of </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/15/702707734/sen-elizabeth-warren-takes-longtime-fight-for-a-level-playing-field-to-2020-race\"><strong>breaking up</strong></a><strong> big tech companies </strong></p>", "<p>Essentially, what \"break them up\" really means is to try to limit the lines of business that Amazon can engage in. So, for instance, Amazon is this platform for online commerce that they themselves are competing on as a store against other stores and retailers. So she has this idea of maybe they shouldn't be competing on a platform that they own, maybe they shouldn't be allowed to be doing that, because they have an unfair advantage. That's in part what break them up means. And so I think it's certainly something that Congress is going to be considering. And I think some of the other candidates have been supportive of that idea of breaking them up.</p>", "<p><strong>On Bezos' space exploration company Blue Origin </strong></p>", "<p>When it comes to Jeff Bezos, he's got two CEOs that are running Amazon and he has stepped away a bit from the company. I mean, he's helping to expand it into India and other places. But as we understand it, his primary goal is to focus on his company Blue Origin. And Blue Origin is his space exploration company. It's his rocket ship company. And essentially it's the fulfillment of something that has been his lifelong goal and plan, which is to, as he puts it, build the infrastructure to go to space and to make it cost-effective for us to figure out what to do in space. ...</p>", "<p>[Bezos] claims \u2014 and I think he's genuine in believing this \u2014 that he wants to save planet Earth, and his whole idea is that he wants there to be dynamism and growth. He believes in capitalism. He believes in consumerism.<strong> </strong>He believes that ... we're going to need to look to the heavens, essentially, to figure out how we can continue to live in a world of dynamism and growth. And that, in Jeff Bezos' mind, means we may need to move heavy industry into space. We may need to mine other planets or planetary objects for their resources, or we may need to actually build space colonies. He is really serious about this.</p>", "<p><em>Heidi Saman and Seth Kelley produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

With the click of a mouse, their laptops become studios, and they're ready to record.</p>", "<p>Keating's class is writing, producing and editing podcasts that they'll submit to the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/11/15/650500116/npr-student-podcast-challenge-home\">NPR Student Podcast Challenge</a>, and, like many teachers, Keating is using apps to help them make it happen. </p>", "<p>As teachers and students around the country are working on their podcasts, we checked in with educators to see what digital tools they're using. </p>", "<p>The good news? Many of these apps are free. They're also accessible. In many classrooms these days, teachers and students have their own laptops, Chromebooks or iPads. In many cases, the technology is already downloaded and, like Keating's eighth-graders, students these days are pretty tech-savvy already. </p>", "<p>All of which means teachers can focus on the substance \u2014 ideas, writing, narrative, editing \u2014 instead of process.</p>", "<p>\"I can spend time helping students develop their stories rather than explaining the app,\" says Amanda Suttle, an English teacher who's using the Anchor app to help her juniors and seniors get their podcasts in shape at Licking Valley High School in Newark, Ohio.</p>", "<p>So, with several weeks still to go before the contest deadline, here are some of the apps and programs teachers told us they're using. (Of course, we're not endorsing these, we're just sharing what we've heard from many of you).</p>", "<p><strong>Anchor</strong></p>", "<p>Developed by Spotify, think of Anchor as a mobile recording studio: With a wi-fi connection, you can record with multiple people in different locations at the same time (as long as they have the app).</p>", "<p>And you can edit what you record right in the app, using simple tools like trimming and removing segments. Other tools let you add transitions, sound effects and background music to help make your podcast unique (NOTE: Please read our strict <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805858075/everything-you-need-to-know-about-using-music-in-your-podcast\">rules</a> on what music you can add to your submission).</p>", "<p>Another benefit for students doing lots of experimenting: No storage limits.</p>", "<p>Amanda Suttle says that when she started using Anchor, she didn't know anything about editing sound. Anchor made it easy. \"It's intuitive,\" she says. \"I love how user-friendly it is, and it's easy to explain.\" </p>", "<p><strong>Audacity</strong></p>", "<p>Of the more advanced, laptop-focused software, Audacity is one of the most popular ones we heard about. It's an audio recording and editing package that is downloadable for both Windows and Mac users. </p>", "<p>With Audacity, you can record directly on your computer's microphone or an external one (although, the audio doesn't need to be recorded with the software to edit it there). </p>", "<p>Eric Applen, who teaches 21st century technology and careers at Friedell Middle School in Rochester, Minn., oversees the school's podcast club and says he taught himself how to use Audacity. \"It just has some really handy features,\" he says. \"It comes down to what's accessible for students and easy for them to use.\"</p>", "<p>He says one of his favorite features is the ability to put together audio segments that were recorded at different times to create one episode. </p>", "<p>Audacity can also export files in various formats, including the wave file format <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/17/677502710/submit-to-the-npr-student-podcast-challenge-here\">you'll need to submit</a> for the Podcast Challenge. </p>", "<p>Stacy Kreitzer is an instructional technology coach for Lower Dauphin Middle School and Lower Dauphin High School in Hummelstown, Pa.

They have step-by-step directions.\"</p>", "<p>Students with Google accounts, like Jones' class, can save their podcasts to their Google Drive through WeVideo. Jones says this makes it easier to export their submissions for the challenge.</p>", "<p><strong>Soundtrap</strong></p>", "<p>Timothy Belmont, an English and public speaking teacher at Lyndhurst High School in Lyndhurst, N.J., wanted to give his students the option to go more in-depth with audio recording and editing. For him, Soundtrap is an accessible way to do that. </p>", "<p>\"It's like a fully functional studio,\" says Belmont. \"They can use it on their iPad through their web browser, but they can also use it on a laptop.\"</p>", "<p> Soundtrap is an online, collaborative music workstation that can edit and record vocals and instruments. </p>", "<p>\"You can even have students who are not necessarily in the same place record together collaboratively,\" says Belmont. That, he adds, \"can extend the assignment from just being during class time to being outside of class.\"</p>", "<p>Since Soundtrap is web-based, there's no installation required and all projects also save to the cloud, allowing students to access their files from multiple devices. </p>", "<p>Joanne Stanley's English students at Swift Creek Middle School in Midlothian, Va., are also using Soundtrap. She says she hasn't used the app very much, and she doesn't have to: Her students have taken the lead and they are working through the \"kinks\" together.</p>", "<p><strong>GarageBand </strong></p>", "<p>GarageBand is a music creation studio that is automatically installed in all Mac and iOS devices.

And then we saw that, in certain scenarios, the French Adrian helmet had performed better.\"<br><br>It was only when those helmets were exposed to overhead blast waves that the 1915-era Adrian helmet outperformed the others.  The Duke researchers point to the raised metal crest running from the front to the back of the Adrian helmet \u2014 a design feature also found on helmets used in those times by French firefighters \u2014 as a likely explanation for its superior protection from overhead blasts. <br><br>\"The geometry of the helmet can make a big difference,\" says Op 't Eynde. \"I'm not sure a crest or something like it would work with a modern design, but just being aware of how the geometry might affect the way that the head and the brain might experience a shock wave is definitely something that I think should be kept in mind in helmet design.\"</p>", "<p>But a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK224915/\">2014 review</a> conducted by a committee created by the National Academies' National Research Council notes that while the Kevlar-based ACH helmet is a significant evolution from its WWI predecessors, the principal approach to helmet design remains protection from striking objects.</p>", "<p>\"The protection of the warfighter afforded by helmets from threats ranging from bullets, shrapnel, blasts, vehicle collisions and parachute landings has improved with improved helmet design and materials,\" the report's authors write. \"However, the level of protection from nonfatal brain tissue injuries, which may have health consequences beyond the acute phase, is not known.\"</p>", "<p>An Army officer with the Program Executive Office Soldier branch that manages protective gear says a research gap explains why there has not been more progress in designing a blast wave-resistant combat helmet. <br><br>\"How much of a blast wave is too much? It's not well-defined,\" says Lt. Col. Ginger Whitehead, the product manager for soldier protective equipment. \"It goes back to the medical community not establishing a correlation of injury to the blast wave.\" <br><br>Others, though, insist that a lack of a complete understanding of how blast waves affect the brain should not be an obstacle to coming up with helmets that do a better job of shielding soldiers' brains. <br><br>\"It's not that you need to know exactly what the medical condition is that results from a blast wave of a certain amount of force,\" says University of Rochester physicist Eric Blackman, who co-authored a <a href=\"http://www.aegisofsoteria.com/public/tbihelmets07new.pdf\">2007 study</a> examining the need for better TBI protection in combat helmets. \"You really need to protect the force from getting in the brain in the first place, and you can do that without knowing exactly what the medical symptoms are.\"<br><br>Retired Gen. Peter Chiarelli has devoted much of his time since leaving active duty in 2012 as Vice Chief of Staff of the Army to advocating a better understanding of war-related TBI.<br><br>\"We've spent billions of dollars \u2014 I did, as vice chief of staff \u2014 researching traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress, and we really haven't gotten much return on that investment,\" says Chiarelli. \"And I would argue it's not necessarily the money that makes the most impact \u2014 it's groups of researchers that are willing to work together, share data, learn from each other, and when they go down that path that doesn't work, they tell each other rather than try to hide that from each other.\"<br><br>The University of Rochester's Blackman is convinced a combat helmet that more fully protects against TBI is both necessary and possible.<br><br>\"There needs to be some kind of prioritization with very specific goals,\" he says. \"Bring people together \u2014 it will happen if there's a concerted effort toward it. If you think of something like the Manhattan project (that produced the first nuclear weapon during World War II) for this, that's what's lacking.\" <br><br>While 100 percent protection may not be possible against blast waves, Blackman adds, the superior performance of a century-old combat helmet should be a reminder that there is ample room for improvement.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

But <a href=\"https://www.smithfarms217.com/#about\">Smith Farms</a> doesn't own most of the land it uses. \"About 75 percent of what we farm is rented ground,\" he says. </p>", "<p>This is common. Across the Midwest, about half of all the farmland is owned by landlords who live somewhere else. Farmers compete to rent that land. \"There's only so much ground, and most of the farmers out there want more, so obviously it gets pretty competitive,\" Smith says. </p>", "<p>These farmer-landowner relationships can last for decades. They sometimes feel personal. So Smith was pretty upset when he heard that a company had sent letters to his landlords a few months ago, offering cash up front to rent the land that he's been farming. </p>", "<p>The letters came from a company called <a href=\"https://tillable.com/\">Tillable</a>, based in Chicago. It's backed by venture capital. </p>", "<p>Corbett Kull, Tillable's CEO, says that his company sent out thousands of these letters to landowners. \"A lot\" of them took the offer, he says. His company will take that land and list it on its website as available to rent. It'll take bids from farmers and then sublet it. </p>", "<p>American farmers spend about $32 billion each year to rent land, and Kull thinks Tillable could be farmland's AirBnB or Zillow. \"This is one of the beauties of digital marketplaces, where you can bring two parties together that otherwise might never meet,\" he says. </p>", "<p>Those letters to landowners, though, got a lot of farmers very angry. \"They're reaching out to our landlords, that we have relationships with, to sort of go behind the farmer's back\" and break up those relationships, Smith says.  </p>", "<p>Smith admits that this kind of thing does happen among farmers competing for land. But another factor played a big role in farmers' reaction. It's an unproven, very Internet-era suspicion about data and privacy. </p>", "<p>Parker Smith, like a lot of farmers, uses equipment that automatically collects all kinds of data about his operations \u2014 like how much fertilizer he applies and how much grain he harvests from each small piece of each field. He pays a company called the Climate Corporation to manage that data and help him understand it. </p>", "<p>Last fall, though, the Climate Corporation and Tillable <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/climate-fieldview-teams-up-with-tillable-to-improve-farm-data-transparency-300935106.html\">announced</a> a partnership. And after Smith learned about Tillable's letters to landowners, Smith had to wonder: Did Tillable target specific landlords because it got access to data about how productive and profitable their land is? </p>", "<p>If someone had his data, Smith says, \"they would know yields; they'd be able to roughly figure out how much money a guy was making.\" </p>", "<p>Just over a week ago, Tillable, the company that's trying to use the Internet to disrupt farming, was itself disrupted by farmers on the Internet. Farmers on Twitter started sharing suspicions about the Tillable-Climate Corporation partnership. They accused the two companies of trafficking in farmer data. </p>", "<p>Corbett Kull denies this. The accusations \"were absolutely false,\" he says. \"We had never accessed the data from Climate [Corporation].\" </p>", "<p>Yet the storm on social media forced the two companies to <a href=\"https://climate.com/newsroom/fieldview-terminates-platform-partner-agreement-with-tillable\">announce</a> that they were cancelling their partnership.  </p>", "<p>Kull says this is not a major blow to Tillable's plans to expand. But the <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.com/news/technology/the-fieldview-tillable-breakup-what-went-wrong\">controversy</a> could have one lasting effect.

Jim Buckmaster, Craigslist's CEO, has been in his job for two decades.</p>", "<p>\"They're both just old-school engineer type guys who just really believe in keeping the design as simple and functional as possible,\" Lingel says. \"[I]t's never had a competitor that was really able to swallow up its user base. It's had loyal customers all along, loyal users all along, so it's just never been forced to adapt.\"</p>", "<p>Craigslist doesn't run banner ads, and according to Lingel, it doesn't sell user data to third parties. It makes money by charging a small number of users to post ads.</p>", "<p>\"Ads like job postings, real estate ads, if you're like a car dealer, furniture dealer, you have to pay a small amount of money, we're talking like $5 to $25 \u2014 and that's this entire revenue stream,\" Lingel says.</p>", "<p>But for most people, it's totally free. It's become the biggest market for classified ads on the Internet. </p>", "<p>Craigslist is also different for being anonymous. Authorities accused the site of facilitating prostitution; it dropped its longtime \"personals\" section in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/23/596460672/craigslist-shuts-down-personals-section-after-congress-passes-bill-on-traffickin\">two years ago</a> after Congress passed the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which aimed to crack down on child sex trafficking. Reports through the years describe Craigslist's role in <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2014/02/20/miranda-barbour-interview\">helping accused killers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/calif-man-arrested-in-rape-of-craigslist-maid/\">rapists</a>, robbers and scammers find their victims.</p>", "<p>As Craigslist celebrates 25 years this year, NPR's Mary Louise Kelly spoke to Lingel, who is also an assistant professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, about how the site has managed to keep on keeping on.</p>", "<p><em>Interview highlights contain extended Web-only content.</em> </p>", "<p><strong>On Craigslist users posting anonymously, contrary to sites such as Facebook</strong></p>", "<p>That policy goes back to Craigslist's early days in the 1990s when it was very common to be anonymous online or pseudonymous, you know, using pseudonyms or fake names. And just like they haven't changed their appearance, they have never let go of that policy. And they see that policy as providing a form of protection and privacy to their users.</p>", "<p>So it is true that there have been some, you know, very violent crimes. There's been scams on Craigslist. But of course, there are also scams on platforms that we think of as much classier or much safer. There's scams on LinkedIn, on eBay, on Facebook. So it isn't so much that the anonymity means that crime happens. It just means that we have a policy to blame. So we do tend to blame the platform more when we can't point at individual users because we don't know anything about them.</p>", "<p><strong>On what she's learned about how Craigslist compares to other sites when it comes to discrimination</strong></p>", "<p>I heard over and over again this sense that Craigslist is part of the poor people's Internet. And what participants and people I interviewed meant by that was that Craigslist sort of has this stigma that using it means you're lower class, using it means you're sort of hard up. But it also meant that people of color, poor people, found that they could use the site in a way that really made sense for them.</p>", "<p>So on a platform like Airbnb, for example, if you're trying to get a rental, people can discriminate against you based on how you look. We actually know for a fact that there have been these high-profile incidents on Airbnb of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/08/493111510/airbnb-unveils-changes-to-address-racial-discrimination\">hosts discriminating against guests</a> because of their name or what they look like.</p>", "<p>So suddenly on a site like Craigslist, you can rent an apartment, you can try and search for a job. And you don't have to worry about people discriminating against you because you're anonymous.</p>", "<p><strong>On Craigslist and the future of the Internet</strong></p>", "<p>I've been studying digital culture for about 10 years and I've always been interested in platforms that are sort of outside the mainstream. And one thing that really interests me about Craigslist is that it's been online for so long, and it hasn't had to change its politics. So Craigslist holds onto these early 1990s Web values about a platform being truly accessible, the platform being open and a platform that doesn't change its appearance. And in that sense, Craigslist reminds us there's a path that a company can take, and it can feel democratic and it can feel less commercial and still be incredibly successful. You know, you don't have to sacrifice your profits in order to protect user data.</p>", "<p><em>NPR's Elena Burnett and Emily Kopp produced and edited the audio version of this story.</em></p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

You can </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money\">sign up here</a>. </p>", "<p>I just got back from my first trip to Japan, and I'm now in love with the country. The ramen, yakitori and sushi. The gorgeous volcanoes. The fascinating people and culture. But of all the things I fell in love with, there's one that I can't stop thinking about: the toilets.  </p>", "<p>Japanese toilets are marvels of technological innovation. They have integrated bidets, which squirt water to clean your private parts. They have dryers and heated seats. They use water efficiently, clean themselves and deodorize the air, so bathrooms actually smell good. They have white noise machines, so you can fill your stall with the sound of rain for relaxation and privacy. Some even have built-in night lights and music players. It's all customizable and controlled by electronic buttons on a panel next to your seat. </p>", "<p>In Japan, these high-tech toilets are everywhere: hotels, restaurants, bus stations, rest stops and <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cao.go.jp/index.html__;!!Iwwt!Fduj5cFOYSChRacNZDmTg8lFUIiksqMhzATugO8NZuVOGFwElFS5LJpsrrmOSg%24\">around 80%</a> of homes. It's glorious. Then, I come back to the United States, and our toilets are stuck in the age of dirty coal mines and the horse and buggy. They basically have one feature: flush. No heated seats. No nice smells and sounds. No sanitizing blasts of liquid. It's like cleaning your dishes without water. It's gross. And it got me thinking: Why can't we have high-tech toilets too? </p>", "<p>Most of the toilets in Japan are made by a company called Toto, which started the high-tech toilet revolution in 1980 when it unveiled the Washlet, a first-of-its-kind electric toilet seat with an integrated bidet. Toto has been innovating on the design ever since. So I reached out to the company. It put me in touch with Bill Strang, the president of corporate strategy and e-commerce at Toto USA.  </p>", "<p>\n                The original Washlet\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Toto\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p>\"U.S. toilets are effectively bedpans with a drain,\" says Strang. Strang is originally from the Midwest, and he joined Toto 17 years ago. That's when he had his first experience with the Washlet bidet, and it was much like mine. It began with \"apprehension, a little bit of angst,\" he says. But then he pushed the spray button and had a joyous sensation. The bathroom would never be the same. </p>", "<p>The Washlet has been for sale in the U.S. since 1990, but it never took off. While Toto has found success with its traditional porcelain products (and manufactures them in the U.S. and Mexico), the Washlet remains a novelty, found mostly at some high-end hotels, showrooms and Japanese restaurants.  </p>", "<p>Economists spend a lot of time analyzing how and why technology spreads from one place to another. They call it \"technology diffusion.\" <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nber.org/papers/w18534__;!!Iwwt!Fduj5cFOYSChRacNZDmTg8lFUIiksqMhzATugO8NZuVOGFwElFS5LJpsIF3aHg%24\">One study</a> looked at the spread of 20 technologies across 161 countries over the last 140 years, and it found evidence that geographic distance significantly slows the spread of new gadgets. It fits with the pattern we see with high-tech toilets. Strang says that after Japan, high-tech toilets have mostly spread to nations along the Pacific Rim.  </p>", "<p>But the speed of technology dispersion has sped up significantly in the modern era. <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nber.org/papers/w11928__;!!Iwwt!Fduj5cFOYSChRacNZDmTg8lFUIiksqMhzATugO8NZuVOGFwElFS5LJrXsDPwrw%24\">Another study </a>found that the spread of technologies developed after 1925 has been three times faster than the spread of those developed before 1925. That makes sense, with modern transportation and communication and all. But it has been many decades since the dawn of the new toilet era in Japan, and we are still mostly sitting on old-fashioned porcelain here. \"Sometimes a technology never diffuses in a given country, even if it is superior to existing technologies,\" says Dartmouth College economist Diego Comin, who co-authored the study.  </p>", "<p>In the end, the biggest barrier to the toilet revolution is probably not distance but cultural mores. The Japanese, Strang says, highly prize bathing, hygiene and cleanliness. When I was in Tokyo and Sapporo, it was common to see Japanese people wearing masks to prevent the spread of germs. When you go out to dinner there, you're often given a hot, moist towel or wet wipe so your hands are clean before you eat. The streets and subways are spotless, and hand-sanitizing dispensers are everywhere. It felt much different from back home.   </p>", "<p>For the last five years, Strang says, Toto has been featuring its technological innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show, and they've made a splash. The company showcased products such as its glistening Neorest NX2 dual flush toilet. It's got the standard bidet, a dryer and a heated seat with temperature control. But it also has a \"tornado flush system,\" a \"bacteria-neutralizing ultraviolet light,\" a \"titanium dioxide-fired toilet bowl,\" a remote control, a toilet seat that automatically opens and closes and an air deodorizer. It costs <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.totousa.com/neorest-nx2-dual-flush-toilet-10-gpf-08-gpf__;!!Iwwt!Fduj5cFOYSChRacNZDmTg8lFUIiksqMhzATugO8NZuVOGFwElFS5LJqfeCjb5A%24\">$17,300</a>. Other Toto toilets and seats cost much less, but the lofty price of Japanese-style toilets are another reason that they might not be catching on.  </p>", "<p>Comin says he has considered buying a Japanese-style toilet, but, he adds, \"they are so darn expensive.\" He believes getting Americans to embrace them would require \"significant investments to educate the public about the new product, marketing (for example, a commercial with George Clooney using a Japanese toilet) and bringing down the price by mass producing.\"  </p>", "<p>But Strang remains optimistic about the future of toilets in America. \"There hasn't been a demand for this type of product in the United States,\" Strang says. \"But there wasn't a demand for Steve Jobs to make a product called the iPhone.\"</p>", "<p><em>Did you enjoy this newsletter?

It had turned down a $1 billion offer to sell itself to Yahoo. It was competing for talented engineers with bigger Silicon Valley neighbors like Google. Facebook needed to define itself.</p>", "<p>Employees quickly zeroed in on where to find their answer: Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO.</p>", "<p>\"<em>He</em> was Facebook culture,\" writes technology journalist Steven Levy in <em>Facebook: The Inside Story</em>, his exhaustive and well-paced history of the tech giant.</p>", "<p>\"Companies are built in the image of their founders,\" one employee tells Levy. \"For a while Facebook felt like a nineteen-year-old's dorm room, but ultimately it's a try-it-and-iterate place, which is how Mark exists as a human. He is a learn-by-doing person, and that is the DNA of the company.\"</p>", "<p>Or to put it another way, \"move fast and break things\" \u2014 which became Facebook's best-known slogan.</p>", "<p>From the viewpoint of 2020, the consequences of Facebook's unprecedented scale and growth \u2014 the spread of political disinformation and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, live streamed suicides, posts fomenting violence against Myanmar's Rohingya minority \u2014 expose the shortcomings of that approach.</p>", "<p>Levy reassesses Facebook's past through today's criticisms: The company wields too much power without adequate trust or accountability.</p>", "<p>The indivisibility of the world's biggest social network from the Harvard dropout who created it is Levy's frame for understanding how Facebook got to where it is today. (It is also a management and financial reality for the company: Zuckerberg is CEO, chairman, and controls more than half of voting shares.)</p>", "<p>Levy's narrative is richly detailed, thanks to interviews with Facebookers past and present. He also got hold of pages from a 2006 notebook of Zuckerberg's, which serves as a sort of Rosetta Stone for some of the most significant decisions the CEO would make to expand Facebook from college campuses to the whole world.</p>", "<p>The company's origin story is well-known, recounted in books and on the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/10/04/130325490/seeing-the-social-network-through-the-eyes-of-silicon-valley\">silver screen</a>. Levy's account of Zuckerberg's abbreviated Harvard tenure and Facebook's early years feel fresh, with plenty of color that reminds you the HBO show Silicon Valley did not have to reach far for its satire.</p>", "<p>The most substantial part of the book is its last third, when Levy dives into the 2016 election and its aftermath. Externally, Facebook faced escalating scrutiny of how its advertising engine and bias toward engaging \u2014 which often meant emotionally extreme \u2014 content were used by Russian operatives to fuel social division. Internally, Zuckerberg, his top deputy Sheryl Sandberg, and other executives failed to quickly grasp the scope of crises over and over again.</p>", "<p>Levy traces the most pressing problems \u2014 \"the disregard for privacy, the data bartering with developers, the reckless international expansion\" \u2014 to the means by which Facebook pursued Zuckerberg's ambition of connecting everyone. He writes:</p>", "<p>\"The decisions [Zuckerberg] has made over the course of the past fifteen years have reflected a secondary set of goals \u2014 growth, competitive supremacy, and seeking massive profits. Because executing these sub-goals would help Facebook in its quest to connect the world, they became hopelessly intermingled with the mission itself, often leading Zuckerberg to make decisions that, in isolation, seem anything but idealistic.\"</p>", "<p>That includes several episodes where Facebook trampled on its users' privacy, such as when it let outside developers \u2014 including, infamously, Cambridge Analytica \u2014 suck up the information not just of people who chose to take the quizzes or play the games they created, but also of their unwitting friends.</p>", "<p>Levy, now a <em>Wired</em> editor-at-large, first met Zuckerberg in 2006. He recounts conversations with the CEO over the years, including a number of interviews Facebook sanctioned as part of substantial access it granted Levy for this book.</p>", "<p>Still, Facebook's founder remains a cipher in a book that in many ways doubles as his biography.

Jack Reed (D-R.I.)</a> and the bureau's public information office provided to NPR.</p>", "<p>Asked by NPR whether the incidents highlighted in the report involved IP addresses linked to Russia, Kevin Smith, the bureau's chief information officer, did not directly answer, saying instead there were no \"nefarious\" actions by \"foreign entities\" during the test run. \"They basically were able to see the website until we further restricted the access to just U.S. territories and U.S. states,\" Smith added.</p>", "<p>Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, had asked Dillingham to provide an explanation for the incidents by Jan. 10, according to <a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=6791547-Dec-10-2019-Letter-From-Sen-Jack-Reed-to-Census\">a letter NPR obtained from the senator's office</a>. In a written statement, the bureau says it responds to letters from Congress \"as soon as we are able to.\" But Reed tells NPR the bureau's delayed response \"undermines confidence in their ability to function effectively.\"</p>", "<p>The bureau says it's monitoring for cyber threats and reviewing its IT systems with help from the Department of Homeland Security, including its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as federal intelligence agencies.</p>", "<p>Reed, who has focused on cybersecurity issues when questioning bureau officials during Senate hearings, remains skeptical about whether the agency is ready to deal with ever-evolving threats.</p>", "<p>\"The Census Bureau has a burden of proof that they're building a census that is not going to be compromised either through a lack of manpower or through cyber intrusions, and they haven't done that to my satisfaction yet,\" Reed says.</p>", "<p><strong>The \"iron door with five locks\"</strong></p>", "<p>As a precaution for 2020, the bureau is blocking IP addresses based outside of the U.S. from accessing the online form. Smith, the bureau's CIO, acknowledges, though, these geoblocking restrictions are a \"very lightweight security measure,\" especially since bad actors can make themselves look like they're coming from within the U.S.</p>", "<p>\"It's like putting a screen door in front of your iron door with five locks,\" Smith says. \"That screen door does a little bit, but not much.\"</p>", "<p>Exactly how that \"iron door with five locks\" is set up, the bureau won't say. It's trying to avoid giving potential census disruptors an advantage. But that, in turn, has created what Smith referred to in <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2018/08/the_census_bureauis.html\">a 2018 blog post</a> as \"an ongoing communications challenge\" given the public scrutiny the technological changes for the 2020 count has drawn.</p>", "<p>The bureau is on the lookout for phishing attempts that try to dupe people into entering personal information on fake census websites. If any are found, Smith says the bureau is planning to alert the public as soon as possible.</p>", "<p>\"But we're not necessarily in direct control as the census to shut down a website,\" Smith <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLZlt83rLZg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3299\">said during a 2018 public meeting</a> at the Census Bureau's headquarters in Suitland, Md.</p>", "<p><strong>Preparing for the \"Beyonc\u00e9 tweet load\"</strong></p>", "<p>Another unknown for the bureau is exactly how many people will try to use the online census form at the same time.</p>", "<p>The bureau is trying to avoid repeating the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2013/10/02/228220325/tech-problems-plague-first-day-of-health-exchange-rollout\">botched 2013 launch of HealthCare.gov</a>. Within two hours of its public debut, that federal government website began experiencing outages partly because it drew up to <a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-14-00350.pdf\">five times more than the expected number of concurrent users</a>.</p>", "<p>For the 2020 census online form, the bureau is trying to pace web traffic by staggering the mailing of letters that direct most U.S. households to my2020census.gov. While it's expecting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hansilowang/status/1111265836923265028?s=20\">about 120,000 users on the census website at the same time</a>, the bureau has been trying to build a system at least five times as strong to handle 600,000 concurrent users. The system can be expanded if there are any higher spikes in traffic, according to Michael Thieme, an assistant director at the bureau who's in charge of systems and contracts for the 2020 census.</p>", "<p>Internally, Thieme says, some bureau officials have been referring to a hypothetical scenario in which Beyonc\u00e9, whose Twitter account has more than 15 million followers, sends a tweet urging people to respond to the 2020 census, driving U.S.-based fans to the online form.</p>", "<p>\"That's what we call our viral load. Some people call that the Beyonc\u00e9 tweet load,\" Thieme adds.</p>", "<p>How much web traffic the online census form can actually take on, however, has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/12/805159481/watchdog-warns-census-faces-cybersecurity-hiring-risks-before-national-rollout\">come under question in recent weeks</a>. The bureau says it recently discovered the IT system that the bureau was planning to rely on as its primary system for collecting online responses could not handle 600,000 concurrent users \"without experiencing performance issues,\" according to<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6776135-GAO-Report-2020-Census-Initial-Enumeration.html\"> a Government Accountability Office report</a>.</p>", "<p>\"It wasn't that we couldn't scale. It was that we noticed the slowdown in performance,\" says Lisa Pintchman, vice president of corporate communications for Pegasystems Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based software contractor that developed the system.</p>", "<p>The bureau says it decided on Feb. 7 \u2014 just over a month before the online form's public debut \u2014 to switch to an in-house system that was intended to be the backup. The system built by Pegasystems, the bureau added, will still be used for other operations and is expected to be the new alternative option in case the in-house system goes down.</p>", "<p>But Nick Marinos, a director at the GAO who leads IT and cybersecurity audits of other federal agencies, warns there is little time left for additional testing of the new setup.</p>", "<p>\"Late design changes, such as a shift from one system to another, can introduce new risk during a critical moment,\" Marinos told lawmakers during the recent House oversight committee hearing.</p>", "<p><strong>The all-paper backup</strong></p>", "<p>As part of a last-ditch backup, the bureau has made a potentially significant change to its census plans by ordering millions of extra paper forms from its Chicago-based printing contractor <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/08/683191846/after-botching-2020-census-contract-officials-pick-new-printer-for-115-million\">R.R.

The bureau previously estimated it would need <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6171780-Request-for-Proposal-for-2020-Census-Printing.html#document/p16/a509331\">around 137 million paper questionnaires</a>. But at a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snzghUEEGRY\">January press conference</a> in Washington, D.C., Fontenot, the bureau's associate director for the 2020 census, said printing was \"completed\" and \"over 120 million\" questionnaires were ready to be stuffed into envelopes.</p>", "<p>Speaking to NPR last month, however, Fontenot said a total of more than 150 million forms have been printed.</p>", "<p>That would be enough to provide one to each of the 140 million-plus households in the country, giving the bureau what Fontenot considers \"the maximum margin of safety\" if what it hopes to be the first primarily online U.S. count has to fall back to all-paper.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Sometimes this fee is paid by the student's parent or guardian, other times schools have enough money set aside to cover the cost themselves.</p>", "<p>The software allows the teams to battle remotely. In the digital age, this may seem unsurprising, but in the early 2000s, to compete against one another, gamers had to physically wire their computers together. This meant dragging your computer to a local area network, or an LAN.</p>", "<p>Today, LANs are still considered the purest form of esports competition, since players are in the same location, eliminating the possibility of lag due to distance. But, thanks to new software, like that provided by PlayVS, high school players can verse opponents from across the state in real time.</p>", "<p>And by partnering with game publishers, PlayVS is able to pull data from matches and track player performance.</p>", "<p>These tools are important to coaches, but also to recruiters, looking to attract talented esports players to top universities and colleges.</p>", "<p>\"There was an opportunity to actually engage them in a competition where the incentive could be something that's meaningful to them at that stage in their life, which a high school championship is within your state,\" says PlayVS CEO and founder Delane Parnell.</p>", "<p>And while the platform does provide the necessary tools for students to get recruited by colleges and maybe, one day go pro, Parnell says when he created PlayVS, he was mostly thinking about the kids that simply play for fun.</p>", "<p>\"Less than 1 percent of kids will go pro,\" Parnell says. \"We actually are focused on making sure that the 99 percent of kids who just care about video games and want to find community and want to be celebrated for a talent that they have are actually able to do so.\"</p>", "<p>At Washington-Liberty, Rocket League player Calvin Forinash has a similar mindset.</p>", "<p>\"I don't think of any of us think that we're gonna go pro and I think it's good for us to realize that so that we don't accidentally put too much time into it and not end up getting anything out of it,\" he says. \"We understand enough about what we can do with this that we are putting in a relatively healthy amount of time, to the point where we can still do other stuff, but still enjoy the game as well.\"</p>", "<p>But even if they don't go pro, esports presents other professional opportunities.</p>", "<p>Jason Chung, an assistant professor of Esports Management and executive director of Esports at the University of New Haven's College of Business, says that as the industry continues to grow there are plenty of other ways to be involved.</p>", "<p>There's esports marketing, business management and game development. Players need physical therapists, trainers, coaches and team managers.</p>", "<p>He says the professionalization of the industry has also helped erode negative gaming stereotypes. Esports has shown that gaming doesn't have to be solitary and instead can be incredibly communal.</p>", "<p>It has also pushed back against the idea of all gamers as individuals who are physically unfit.</p>", "<p>\"I think in a certain way there has been some truth to the narrative, in terms of the stereotypes of gamers, as chugging Mountain Dew and eating Doritos in a basement. That was a stereotype for a reason,\" says Chung.</p>", "<p>But, he says that is largely no longer the case.</p>", "<p>\"I think the thing that's changed now in the professional space is that they're realizing that just having screen time and training, is not sufficient,\" says Chung. \"You need to do other things to make the athletes healthy all around.\"</p>", "<p>While Chung believes that esports belong in high schools, he believes that politicians and administrators need to take a bigger role to regulate esports before it gets too big.</p>", "<p>\n                Much like traditional sports, students learn communication, how to handle stress and overcome failure through esports.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Kisha Ravi/NPR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Much like traditional sports, students learn communication, how to handle stress and overcome failure through esports.</p>", "<p>\"I'd like to see is a little bit more leadership by state and local actors and hopefully with some federal coordination to really outline what principles and what sort of values they want to instill [through esports],\" Chung says. \"What are some of the physical fitness requirements you want to actually put in there? Because ultimately, whether it's a sport or a tech product or whatever it is, if we're going to have high school age kids play it, you want to have some sort of healthy mindset in there.\"</p>", "<p>Parnell thinks that PlayVS's partnership with local high schools is a step in the right direction and helps prevent players from getting burned out too early or from developing \"toxic behavior.\"</p>", "<p>\"I think what makes this more sustainable overall is that we're actually providing a structured environment for kids to play video games, which they would otherwise do unstructured,\" Parnell says. \"We've implemented a coach, which is an adult in the room and that is super important.\"</p>", "<p>This year Virginia is piloting their esports league.

It's very welcoming for immigrants,\" Chitnis says. \"There are a lot of services by the government to help newcomer entrepreneurs especially. So the whole ecosystem is pretty welcoming compared to the U.S.\"</p>", "<p>If there is a war for global tech talent, right now Canada is winning \u2014 and the U.S. may be losing its edge.

Vancouver also made the top five.</p>", "<p>The tech industry across Canada is booming. And one of the biggest reasons is U.S. immigration policy. The Trump administration has made it harder for high-skilled workers to get visas. It also has blocked entrepreneurs from some majority-Muslim countries altogether under the travel ban, which it's moving to expand to more countries.</p>", "<p>Canada, meanwhile, has been making it easier for tech workers to immigrate there. A new streamlined visa in Canada has brought in more than 40,000 tech workers from around the world in the past two years alone.</p>", "<p>\"While the States has gone, 'Let's make it difficult to get the employees here on a visa,' Canada's gone the exact opposite, and it's beneficial for Canada,\" says Alex Norman, the other co-founder of TechToronto. \"You had a fast-growing ecosystem here that's been getting a shot of steroids.\"</p>", "<p>Under the Trump administration, high-skilled workers are getting rejected at a higher rate. In 2015, 92% of new H-1B visa applications were approved. But in the last two years, the approval rate dipped to only 75%.</p>", "<p>Immigration authorities say they're trying to ensure that companies follow the rules. Employers are required to show that hiring a foreign worker will not hurt Americans.</p>", "<p>\"You know, I have a high regard \u2014 as does the president \u2014 for protecting U.S. workers,\" said Ken Cuccinelli, who was then the acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in <a href=\"https://cis.org/Immigration-Newsmaker/Conversation-USCIS-Acting-Director-Ken-Cuccinelli\">an interview last year</a>.</p>", "<p>Cuccinelli was asked about the need to crack down on fraud and abuse. \"The H-1B program has been controversial in this regard,\" he said. \"And it is concerning.\"</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, U.S. tech companies complain that they can't find enough qualified candidates to fill all their open jobs.</p>", "<p>More than a dozen hiring managers from tech startups recently squeezed into a private dining room at Del Posto, a high-end New York City restaurant.

They came for the New York strip steak and Italian wine \u2014 but also to hear a business pitch from Irfhan Rawji, the founder of a Canadian company called MobSquad .</p>", "<p>\"If you'd rather fill a job than go without, call us,\" Rawji said. \"We'll open a virtual subsidiary for you in Canada. You get access to the world.\"</p>", "<p>Rawji's pitch, in a nutshell, is this: Say your firm wants to hire an international tech worker, but the worker's visa application is rejected or the application process is dragging on for months.</p>", "<p>\"The next-best solution to keeping them here in the U.S., if you can't do that, is to put them in Canada,\" Rawji said. \"The flights are an hour and a half to two hours. It's the same business culture.

After all, who can forget the massive hack of the Hillary Clinton campaign's emails during the last presidential election and its embarrassing consequences?</p>", "<p>The reelection campaign of Maine Sen. Angus King took this to heart. Lisa Kaplan, King's digital director, regularly sent out fake emails to her staff to \"see who would click on them.\" Those emails during the 2018 campaign looked real \u2014 but they were not.</p>", "<p>The goal was to keep staff members on their toes so they wouldn't fall for emails from real hackers intent on damaging the campaign.</p>", "<p>\"We would try to get them to do things like change their password for their email or change their password for the database we were using,\" Kaplan said.</p>", "<p>It's this kind of attention to detail and seriousness about<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/754498433/secure-your-vote-2020-election-security\"> security </a>that political veterans and party officials are urging on candidates and their staffs. Starting next week, the first votes in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries will be cast. Even more campaigns \u2014 from congressional races to local contests for mayor and city council \u2014 are gearing up for November's election.</p>", "<p>Communication is the lifeblood of any political campaign, but it can also be the thing that sinks it if messages <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/28/633056819/russian-hackers-targeted-the-most-vulnerable-part-of-u-s-elections-again\">get hacked</a> or manipulated. Email and social media accounts can be taken over. Sensitive or embarrassing documents can be leaked, and false information can really damage a campaign.</p>", "<p>Campaigns are especially vulnerable because they operate like startups: They're created from the ground up and add staff quickly. People move in and out of jobs quickly and bring in new phones and laptops.</p>", "<p>\"Campaigns are effectively startups, but their risk profile is more like established large businesses,\" said Mark Risher, who works on account security at Google.</p>", "<p>Additional risk comes from staffers using personal cellphones, computers and email accounts to work on sensitive material.</p>", "<p>That rapid, often chaotic growth creates openings for hackers.</p>", "<p>\"You have almost every worst-case scenario,\" said Mary Dickinson, a co-founder of U.S. CyberDome, a nonprofit offering free cybersecurity services to campaigns.</p>", "<p>\"You can't really do effective training because you've got people coming on board all the time,\" she said. And since it's normal for people to bring their own devices into the campaigns, \"you've got used devices that are not scrubbed being brought into the food chain,\" Dickinson said.</p>", "<p>The most infamous hack of a campaign happened in 2016, when Russians broke into the Gmail account of Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/14/629058505/clinton-campaign-chairman-john-podesta-on-russian-indictments\">John Podesta</a>. Some of the emails were embarrassing, such as Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street banks.</p>", "<p>The Russians got into Podesta's email account through a <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2017/05/04/phishing-security-gmail-hacks\">phishing attack</a> \u2014 where hackers send emails disguised to look like they're from a familiar sender or from a known entity like a bank. They try to trick people into handing over passwords.</p>", "<p>Phishing is \"very, very cheap to perpetrate [and] very, very easy to scale,\" Risher said. \"The attackers get to keep trying again and again until they succeed, and the target only has to make a mistake once.\"</p>", "<p>Nearly four years after the Clinton campaign email hack, phishing attacks haven't changed much, Risher said.</p>", "<p>\"The attackers are still mostly using the same techniques that were effective in 2016, 2017, 2018. They haven't evolved because they haven't needed to,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Despite ample evidence that political figures are targets, they remain vulnerable.

And 60% said they haven't significantly updated the security of their accounts since 2016.</p>", "<p>So what should campaigns do to get serious about security?</p>", "<p>At the top of the list is taking basic precautions to protect email and other accounts.</p>", "<p>That includes <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/25/773199525/sim-swap-scams-expose-risks-of-using-phones-for-secondary-i-d\">multifactor authentication</a>, which requires people to enter not just a password but also a code sent to their smartphone or from a special hardware key.

Once they reached low Earth orbit, the satellites were released and began to fan out like a deck of cards.</p>", "<p>They follow predictable paths around the Earth, but along the way those paths can cross with other things in orbit \u2014 satellites from other companies, old rocket stages, loose bits of metal \u2014 and cause a catastrophic collision.</p>", "<p>Some satellite operations experts say that all too often, only one thing stands in the way of disaster: an automated email alert sent to the inboxes of operators on the ground.</p>", "<p>\"That is crazy,\" says Brian Weeden, director of program planning at the Secure World Foundation, which promotes sustainability in space. \"But that's currently the status of things.\"</p>", "<p>Now Weeden and others feel it's time for a hard look at the system for managing space traffic, which they think is ad hoc and ill-prepared for what's to come. In just three launches since November, SpaceX has added nearly 200 satellites to a slice of the sky above Earth that's already pretty congested. It plans to launch hundreds more this year, as does a rival company, OneWeb. Both companies say they are diligently complying with voluntary standards to minimize space debris, but critics say those standards simply aren't adequate.</p>", "<p>\"We're already out in front of the headlights, so to speak,\" says Moriba Jah, an expert in orbital mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin. \"And I think a major cataclysm of some form will happen in space that will have very long-term consequences.\"</p>", "<p>The closest thing the world has to a space traffic control is the U.S. military's 18th Space Control Squadron. \"Currently, we have a catalog of approximately 26,000 objects,\" says Diana McKissock, who helps oversee what the military calls \"space situational awareness.\" (That's a fancy name for keeping tabs on everything up there that's bigger than about the size of a softball.)</p>", "<p>The military tracks all of it with a global network of radars and telescopes. It takes measurements and then feeds them into an old computer. \"It was first designed in 1983, but the version that we currently use was considered operational in 1996,\" McKissock says.</p>", "<p>\n                The military uses radars to watch for ballistic missiles. It also tracks satellites.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Cameron Hunt/21st Space Wing Public Affairs\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">The military uses radars to watch for ballistic missiles. It also tracks satellites.</p>", "<p>Each day, the computer system calculates thousands of potential collisions between objects and spits out the appropriate warnings.</p>", "<p>With SpaceX launching satellites by the dozens, the 18th Space Control Squadron has been put to the test. Each new satellite must be individually identified and tracked by the network long enough to establish its orbital path. SpaceX says it is committed to helping ensure safety in space. The company has been supplying the military with orbital data to speed the identification and tracking process.</p>", "<p>\"I won't say it's easy,\" McKissock says. \"But I will say when faced with a challenge, it's amazing what innovation can come out of meeting that challenge.\"</p>", "<p>For critics of the current system, the real issues come after possible collisions are identified. Once a warning message is sent, McKissock says, the military has no further role in what happens next. \"There is nothing in place after we send those messages to ensure that people are making decisions that benefit the entire space community,\" she says.</p>", "<p>About six months ago, a SpaceX satellite and a European Space Agency satellite were predicted to have a close pass. SpaceX saw an initial email from the military and felt that the two satellites would probably speed by each other at a safe distance. The problem, says Weeden of the Secure World Foundation, was that there was a second email.</p>", "<p>I think a major cataclysm of some form will happen in space that will have very long-term consequences.</p>", "<p class=\"byline\">Moriba Jah, orbital mechanics expert</p>", "<p>\"There was a new email they got that had a much closer approach that somehow got trapped in a spam folder or just didn't make it to the right people,\" he says. \"That was a problem.\"</p>", "<p>SpaceX says it has fixed that problem. But Weeden says the real issue runs deeper. There are no standards for how close is too close or what satellite operators should do if they get a notice of a possible collision: \"It's up to each and every operator to decide for themselves what they want to do, if anything, in response to those close-approach warnings.\"</p>", "<p>Jah says there's an incentive not to move \u2014 because to get out of the way, satellites have to expend some of their precious fuel. \"Propellant is like platinum up there,\" he says. \"Whenever my propellant is gone, I'm done. I don't make money or I lose the service.\" Operators must weigh the risks to their satellite against these very real costs, and they can arrive at different decisions.</p>", "<p>SpaceX's new Starlink system is supposed to entail thousands of satellites. The company says it's developing an automated collision-avoidance system so satellites can move themselves out of the way.</p>", "<p>\n                Each Starlink launch contains a stack of 60 or so satellites.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    SpaceX\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Each Starlink launch contains a stack of 60 or so satellites.</p>", "<p>But that doesn't satisfy Jah. As many hundreds of new satellites go up this year, he says, the companies can't just make decisions in a vacuum. Often, a company will rely on its own highly accurate data for its satellites \u2014 but use lower-quality public data for other objects. Foreign governments also have their own data. All of this means that companies might not reach the same conclusions on the potential for a crash or how to move out of the way.</p>", "<p>\"Each of them thinks of themselves to be quite smart, and we have the right people to maybe automate maneuvers or figure these things out,\" he says. \"But that's done in the absence of the reasoning of the other people.\"</p>", "<p>Jah believes what's needed is a global set of standards for what data to use and for how close is too close and regulations that clearly lay out the right of way. But, he says, such a system remains far off and there's no obvious international body that could take on the responsibility for such rules.</p>", "<p>In the U.S., the Commerce Department might take a larger role. The Trump administration has tasked that department with overseeing commercial uses of space, but it's just getting started. In the meantime, the job of coordinating space traffic remains spread across the military, which monitors for collisions, and the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Aviation Administration, which approve and oversee launches.</p>", "<p>Given the current system, Jah worries that a collision is only a matter of time. If it happens, \"people will move swiftly to try to do something,\" he says. \"But I think it's going to be reactionary, unfortunately.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

It is implicated in espionage in the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands, [and] has allegedly stolen intellectual property from foreign competitors in Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>", "<p>David Edelman was on the National Security Council under President Obama and now runs MIT's Internet Policy Research Initiative. He puts it this way: \"The administration's case goes like this. They say first that Huawei equipment is generally less secure than its competitors. Second, that Chinese security services might find it irresistible to try to steal secrets. Third, and maybe most dramatically, if there were ever a major conflict, Beijing might use that access to remotely shut down critical systems.\"</p>", "<p>Britain says it decision is based in part on working with Huawei for years on its existing cellular system. Britain also believes it can manage the risk by limiting Huawei to the periphery of the new network \u2014 things like base stations and antennas that mostly pass on data \u2014 and keeping it away from the more sensitive network core.</p>", "<p>This 5G network hasn't yet been built, and the U.S. hasn't yet given up making its case. Pompeo was in Britain on Wednesday and said he would continue to stress U.S. security concerns.</p>", "<p>\"The real question here is whether we've crossed a particular Rubicon, whether by having this Chinese content in the underlying 5G network, that effectively it's a decision that can't be reversed,\" Edelman said.</p>", "<p>Which brings us to the second big issue \u2014 the global technology competition.</p>", "<p>For many in the West, China is viewed as a giant factory that puts together iPhones. But the latest development means it's now been cleared to help build a cutting-edge network in Western Europe.</p>", "<p>5G is being billed as revolutionary. Data will move a lightning speed, driverless cars will communicate with each other, doctors will perform surgery remotely. And China is now considered at the forefront.</p>", "<p>\"China is today a major player in the technology market,\" said Beau Woods, who studies cyber issues at the Atlantic Council in Washington. The British decision, he added, \"is a big win for China's prestige and also kind of puts other nations, other companies, on notice that China's not just the packaging and assembly hub of the world anymore.\"</p>", "<p>China's stated goal is to be a world leader in the most important technologies of the 21st century. To this end, the government supports Huawei and other tech companies in ways that Western countries don't, said Dean Cheng with the Heritage Foundation.</p>", "<p>When it comes to 5G, he said, Huawei offers the complete package, something Western firms can't match at this point.</p>", "<p>\"They offer essentially soup to nuts,\" Cheng said. \"That's a huge advantage in terms of the whole system being integrated. It presumably works well with each other. Also, it is significantly cheaper than any of the partial competitors out there.\"</p>", "<p>All this makes it harder on the third big issue \u2014 U.S. foreign policy. The Trump administration has pressed American allies to keep Chinese hardware out of their sensitive networks. The results have been mixed at best.</p>", "<p>\"If you're not getting your closest intelligence partners on board, how can you expect to get the rest of Europe or Latin America, Africa?\" Peter Singer asked. \"The thing to watch for is the dominoes falling. All the other states that have been holding back, may be saying, 'OK, the Brits are going this way now. We can, too.'\"</p>", "<p>Just a day after the British decision, the European Union on Wednesday recommended limiting, but not banning, \"high-risk\" companies.

That's extraordinarily difficult, to do that kind of thing under pressure,\" says Jones. \"Downloading an app at the last minute is crazy.\"</p>", "<p>Elesha Gayman, the Democratic Party chair in Scott County, said their attempts were complicated by measures put in place to protect the reporting system against outside attacks.</p>", "<p>\"We had a lot of our precinct captains and temporary chairs, and permanent chairs, that were trying to log in to the system, and quite frankly there were so many layers of security, they would get messed up,\" she said. Out of frustration, they resorted to calling a backup hotline, which was quickly overwhelmed with calls.</p>", "<p>There were other worrisome things that occurred Monday night, which election experts see as warning signs of the kinds of problems that can emerge in the months ahead.</p>", "<p><strong>Secrecy Fed Unrealistic Expectations Around Results Timing</strong></p>", "<p>Iowa Democratic Party officials were secretive about the details of the new smartphone app and whether it had been tested in advance for possible flaws.</p>", "<p>When things began to go awry, the party was vague for hours about what was causing the delay, leaving the public and campaigns confused, frustrated and even suspicious. The party had promised the new app would also mean quicker results, but instead the hours dragged on with nothing to report.</p>", "<p>\"The media is ready to go and everyone's ready to declare a winner and the candidates have their speeches and there's this sense of anticipation,\" says Rick Hasen, an election law expert who has just written a book \u2014 <em>Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust, and the Threat to American Democracy</em> \u2014 about all the things that could go wrong in 2020.</p>", "<p>\"If the Iowa Democratic Party had said, 'Well, it's going to be a day or two before we have results,' people's expectations would have been managed,\" Hasen said.</p>", "<p>Election experts say that should be the message going forward and officials shouldn't be pressured into rushing out results that later prove to be wrong. They warn that votes could take an especially long time to count this year, in what's expected to be a high-turnout election with widespread use of mail-in ballots.</p>", "<p><strong>New Voting Technologies Rolled Out Too Quickly</strong></p>", "<p>While Iowa's caucuses are unique, others have also been considering the use of smartphone apps and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/798126153/exclusive-seattle-area-voters-to-vote-by-smartphone-in-1st-for-u-s-elections\">Internet voting</a>.</p>", "<p>Monday's meltdown has given them pause.</p>", "<p>On Tuesday, Nevada's Democratic Party announced that it will not be using an app like Iowa's in its Feb. 22 caucuses despite having paid tens of thousands of dollars to the developer, a company called Shadow.</p>", "<p>But Hasen notes that there are a number of states, such as Pennsylvania, that will be using all new voting equipment this year and that could lead to breakdowns and confusion.</p>", "<p>Some have already encountered problems.</p>", "<p>A county in Pennsylvania had an election last November in which the machines showed only a handful of votes for a judicial candidate, while a recount showed that in fact he had won.

They also breathed a sigh of relief that the problem emerged last year, while there was still time to fix it before this year's election.</p>", "<p><strong>Uncertainty Fed Conspiracy Theories</strong></p>", "<p>It wasn't long after it became clear there was a problem in Iowa that the conspiracy theories began to fly.</p>", "<p>\"Dems rigging it in Iowa? Such a peculiar vote delay. They just can't let the People have their say!\" tweeted Kayleigh McEnany, press secretary for President Trump's reelection campaign. Donald Trump Jr. alleged, without evidence, that Iowa Democrats were \"fixing the results to get the candidate the Democrat Overlords in DC want.\"</p>", "<p>Some Democrats also raised questions about the legitimacy of the vote, even hinting that the system had been hacked, something quickly dismissed by security officials.</p>", "<p>The spread of disinformation, especially on social media, is seen as one of the most serious threats to public confidence in this year's elections. \"We need to be on guard against that and really watch against disinformation and attempts to rile people up in an already very polarized environment,\" says Hasen.</p>", "<p><strong>\"Teachable Moment\"</strong></p>", "<p>Iowa caucuses are different from primaries and general elections because they're conducted by party officials, not by people who run elections as a full-time job.</p>", "<p>But that left a serious gap. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate issued a release making clear that his office had \"'no official role in the Iowa Caucuses.\" Federal authorities were in contact throughout the evening with party officials, checking to make sure there were no signs of a cyberattack.</p>", "<p>But they deferred to the Iowa Democratic Party to tell the public what was going on. Department of Homeland Security officials also say they offered to test the new smartphone app for security flaws in advance of the caucuses, but that the Iowa Democratic Party declined.</p>", "<p>\"Was it satisfying? No. Was it frustrating? Yes,\" says Christopher Krebs, who runs the DHS cybersecurity agency that works on election security. But Krebs called the Iowa meltdown a \"teachable moment,\" a stark reminder to those running elections that they need to be prepared for every contingency.</p>", "<p>\"Do you have your plan?\" asks Krebs. \"If something goes wrong do you know who you're going to call, what you're going to say to the political parties, what you're going to say to the press, what you are going to say to the voting public?\"</p>", "<p>Krebs says one good lesson learned from the Iowa incident is that having a paper record of votes \u2014 which the caucuses did \u2014 is key. If something happens to the technology, he says, those paper ballots are available to count and audit and to reassure the public that the results are accurate.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Those backups involved having caucusgoers use paper ballots to record their votes and reporting results over a hotline. In Iowa, however, a backup hotline that precinct chairs tried to use on caucus night was quickly overwhelmed after the app failed. </p>", "<p>Coming up with an alternative plan in Nevada is challenging. The state's Democratic caucuses are complicated because they involve four days of early voting at dozens of sites around the state. The initial plan was to have early caucusgoers use electronic tablets to record their votes, which would eventually be transmitted to individual precinct chairs on caucus day using a different app.  Those chairs were supposed to use that app to conduct the caucuses and then submit the final results to the party.  </p>", "<p>Now, that complicated coordination between early votes and hundreds of precincts on caucus day will have to be done without any mobile apps, possibly with just paper and manual counts. </p>", "<p>\"Those are two really big pieces, with lots of logistics involved, and it's important that people understand what they'll be doing,\" says David Levine, a former Idaho county election official who is now with the advocacy group Alliance for Securing Democracy.</p>", "<p>Whatever process the party chooses, Levine says it's crucial that officials and caucus volunteers get to practice in advance so any problems and vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed before the actual voting begins. </p>", "<p>But there's not much time left. Early voting is set to begin on Feb. 15. </p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

That's according to Joy Buolamwini, whose research caught wide attention in 2018 with \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxuyfWoVV98\">AI, Ain't I a Woman</a>?\" a spoken-word piece based on her findings at MIT Media Lab.</p>", "<p>The video, along with <a href=\"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf\">the accompanying research paper</a> written with Timnit Gebru of Microsoft Research, prompted many tech companies to reassess their facial recognition data sets and algorithms for darker and more female-looking faces.</p>", "<p>\"Coded Bias,\" a documentary directed by Shalini Kantayya which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in late January, interweaves Buolamwini's journey of creating the <a href=\"https://www.ajlunited.org/\">Algorithmic Justice League</a>, an advocacy organization, with other examples of facial recognition software being rolled out around the world \u2014 on the streets of London, in housing projects in Brooklyn and broadly across China.</p>", "<p>Jennifer 8. Lee, a journalist and documentary producer, caught up with Joy Buolamwini and Shalini Kantayya in Park City, Utah after the premiere of Coded Bias. The interview has been condensed for length and clarity.</p>", "<p><strong>Joy, why do you combine technology and arts in your work?</strong></p>", "<p>Buolamwini: So I am a poet in code \u2014 P.O.C. We need more poets in tech, and we need more people of color in tech. The reason I call myself a poet is because poets illuminate the uncomfortable, and they make us feel what we otherwise not might see. And I realized as I was doing these research papers with MIT that performance metrics and statistical analysis only get you so far. So how do you get from performance metrics to performance arts, where it hits you in a visceral way, so that you can humanize the implications of what we were showing with the research?</p>", "<p><strong>Shalini, a striking number of the characters and the experts interviewed in the film are women. Why?</strong></p>", "<p>Kantayya: My film is mostly women, but it was not intentional when I began the film. What I found was there was this group of mathematicians and data scientists who were incredibly astute, well researched, but at the same time had this commitment to their humanity. Many had a double identity: were a woman, were of color. And that allowed them to see this issue from an entirely different perspective. For me, many of the parallels in the film industry I see happening in the tech industry, and I could very much relate to these women in tech, like issues of representation.</p>", "<p><strong>What was it like testifying about your work in front of the House of Representatives, especially given that the Senate hearing for Mark Zuckerberg did not put the technological sophistication of Senators in the best light?</strong></p>", "<p>Buolamwini: Many of the committee members had in-depth questions, so they used all of their time. I was really surprised how into the weeds they got, because we do our spoken testimony, three to five minutes, then we have the written testimony which is 20 pages, and they were referencing components where if you didn't really read it, you wouldn't have gotten that in-depth. </p>", "<p>So I was surprised at first, and then they had a second hearing and they had a third hearing. They were saying that this is one of the committee's favorite topics \u2014 facial recognition \u2014 because you actually have support and agreement across both sides of the aisle, and it's very difficult to find topics like that in this current political state.</p>", "<p>Kantayya: By going to the hearing, I actually learned that our government actually works sometimes.</p>", "<p><strong>What would the regulatory oversight of algorithms and artificial intelligence look like?</strong></p>", "<p>Buolamwini: I'm actually working with a group of researchers on a paper right now. The major issue is that level of expertise is not going to happen in government, and so we have been looking at a hybrid model where you can have an institution that enables expertise to be cultivated. So that when companies are planning or hoping to deploy A.I. systems, it's not just \"spray and pray.\" You actually have to verify the claims of your system. With the FDA model, it's acknowledged that not all drugs work for everybody. There are limitations.</p>", "<p><strong>How did you come up with the idea of putting a white mask on in order to get the computer software to recognize your face?</strong></p>", "<p>Buolamwini: The reason I had a white mask in my office was while I was at MIT working hard, one of the older graduate women said, \"We need a girls' night out,\" and it was a girls' night out during Halloween.\" Before we went out, she said, \"We're going to do masks.\" So I thought it was a costume party and I bought a white mask for the costume party. I show up and it turned out to be facial masks, like a spa treatment! And because I had misunderstood the kind of masks she was talking about, it is why I had a white mask. I was a little embarrassed and I left it in my office.</p>", "<p>And so when I came back from going out, I still had this project to do. I was really frustrated trying to get it to work and it was late. I kept trying different ways to detect my face. And the white mask was just sitting there. And I was like, \"No way.\" I grabbed it, and it was almost immediate. I hadn't even turned it all the way, even from an angle it was already picking it up as a face, and I put it on. And I was like, <em>this is crazy</em>. I don't know if this would have happened if I hadn't misunderstood \"girls' night out.\"</p>", "<p><em>Jennifer 8.

Five days later, at least two doctors independently of each other began quietly warning other medical staff about several patients exhibiting pneumonialike symptoms after having visited the same seafood and live animal market in Wuhan.</p>", "<p>One of those doctors was Xie Linka, an oncologist at Wuhan Union Hospital. Her colleagues in the hospital's respiratory unit had taken in \"many patients\" exhibiting an unknown pneumonia. \"Be sure to wear masks and ventilate areas,\" <a href=\"https://finance.sina.cn/2020-02-02/detail-iimxxste8056177.d.html\">she posted</a> in a group on WeChat, the Chinese messaging app.</p>", "<p>Li, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central University, also warned a group of about 150 alumni in a WeChat group that \"seven SARS patients,\" all connected to a local seafood market, were being quarantined at his hospital.

With only hours to spare before all trains and planes were prohibited from departing, residents with cars rushed to highways.

Before the quarantine, 5 million people were able to hastily leave the city, Mayor Zhou Xianwang later admitted.</p>", "<p>Cities outside the official quarantine zone have adopted their own drastic measures to limit movement. Remote villages have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800350322/chinese-officials-try-hard-to-contain-coronavirus\">bottled in </a>their residents in an effort to stop the virus from entering their communities. Other villages have torn up roads or built hasty barricades to keep migrant workers out. Various cities in coastal Zhejiang province now only allow one person per household to leave for groceries every two days.</p>", "<p>As the number of cases, particularly in the city of Wuhan, continue to climb, authorities are turning to even more extreme measures. On Thursday, a top Chinese official urged local officials and residents in Wuhan to report anyone they see with symptoms and to send loved ones with symptoms to new, mass quarantine centers.</p>", "<p>\"There must be no deserters during a state of war.

Soon after, social media platforms, including WeChat, began suspending accounts found to have spread \"sensitive information or illegal content,\" according to screenshots of sealed accounts. Tencent did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.</p>", "<p>\"I think what this act is telling us is that the discussions online are entering into the zone of perceived sensitivity for the state,\" says Repnikova of Georgia State University. While earlier, uninhibited reporting provided valuable public knowledge about the outbreak, \"it's evident that more supplies and more diagnostic equipment are needed. The benefit of allowing more social media critique is also getting slimmer.\"</p>", "<p>One of the thousands of WeChat accounts suspended this week belonged to Triv Wen, a Beijing municipal engineer. His apparent offense: sharing an article that accused the Wuhan Red Cross of withholding much-needed supplies like masks from hospitals. (Earlier this week, the Hubei government <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-02/04/c_1125530316.htm\">fired</a> the vice president of the provincial Red Cross for \"malpractice and dereliction of duty.\")</p>", "<p>\"All I hope is that the people have the right to hold the government accountable rather than to be managed,\" Wen told NPR, whose parents are both card-carrying members of the Communist Party. \"From the bottom of my heart, I want everything to become better and speech to be more open and transparent.\"</p>", "<p>In <a href=\"http://china.caixin.com/2020-02-07/101512460.html\">one of his last interviews before his death</a>, with independent Chinese media outlet Caixin, Li said helping the public learn about the truth was far more important to him than getting justice for himself: \"A healthy society should not have only one kind of voice.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Fleet vehicles are increasingly going electric in Europe and China, and some analysts say American fleets will be following suit.</p>", "<p>As electric cars grow in popularity and visibility, experts say a revolution is coming in a place most people overlook: corporate and municipal fleets.</p>", "<p>The scooter company Lime is the latest firm <a href=\"https://www.li.me/second-street/lime-commits-to-100-zero-emissions-operations-fleet-vehicles\">to announce</a> that it plans to completely remove gas- and diesel-powered vehicles from its fleet and power its new electric work vehicles with renewable energy.</p>", "<p>Lime is famous, of course, for electric vehicles \u2014 the small <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/05/14/723003882/will-scootermania-end-with-a-crash\">battery-powered scooters</a> that have popped up on sidewalks across the United States. And as the world's largest scooter company, it promotes itself as an eco-friendly alternative to driving. But so far, some gas-guzzling is still involved behind the scenes.</p>", "<p>\"All of our scooters and e-bikes are already electric, already powered by renewables,\" says Andrew Savage, the head of sustainability at Lime. \"We're going to take the vans and the vehicles used to manage those programs and transition those to zero emissions as well.\"</p>", "<p>Lime's fleet isn't large \u2014 a few hundred vehicles for now. But the company is not alone in plotting the switch.</p>", "<p>Lime, along with companies like Ikea and Unilever, is joining the <a href=\"https://www.theclimategroup.org/ev100-members\">EV100 initiative</a> to commit to an all-electric fleet. Other large companies, such as DHL, Amazon and AT&amp;T, have committed to \"accelerating\" the transition to electric fleet vehicles.</p>", "<p>Millions of fleet vehicles are on the road \u2014 everything from delivery trucks and maintenance vans to police cars and school buses. Right now, less than 1% of those vehicles are electric, according to the consulting firm Guidehouse (formerly known as Navigant). </p>", "<p>But in a decade, the group predicts that 12% of fleet vehicles will be plug-ins. That will mean a rise from about 2 million electric fleet vehicles now to more than 70 million in 2030. </p>", "<p>\"Given the life span of vehicles ... 12% [of the] population will require a significant portion of new vehicles sold being plug-in electric vehicles,\" says Guidehouse's Ted Walker.</p>", "<p>Interest in sustainability will drive some of that growth. Companies like Lime that market themselves as climate friendly or have made climate pledges to investors and partners need to reduce the emissions from their fleets in order to restrain emissions. And around the world \u2014 particularly in Europe and China \u2014 government pressure is spurring investment in electric vehicles of all types.</p>", "<p>But there are other factors too. In some ways, selling electric vehicles to companies is easier than selling one to an individual car owner.</p>", "<p>Consider the price. \"Electric vehicles are going to have a higher purchase price, but there's a lower maintenance, lower fuel cost,\" Walker says. Where an individual might focus on the sticker shock, a company is more likely to consider the lifetime cost of the vehicle.</p>", "<p>Then there's range anxiety. It takes longer to charge a battery than to fill up a gas tank, and some people (particularly those who have never owned or leased an electric vehicle) worry that they'll go on a long trip and run out of juice. The concern is common even for drivers who very rarely drive long distances.</p>", "<p>Fleet operators think differently; they know how far their cars go in a day, says Steve Burns, the CEO of Lordstown Motors. <a href=\"https://www.wksu.org/post/what-lordstown-motors#stream/0\">The Ohio startup</a> is making a pickup truck specifically to sell to fleets.</p>", "<p>\"We are catering mostly to people that stay local \u2014 whether that's a florist, a landscaper, a police officer,\" Burns says. \"[Our truck] can go 250 miles on a charge.

He says his constituents, especially seniors, have also complained about a spurt of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/08/575056358/when-the-cash-register-doesnt-take-cash\">cashless stores</a>. So Torres led the charge on a bill to ban businesses from rejecting cash, which New York's city leaders <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/nyregion/nyc-cashless-ban.html\">passed </a>almost unanimously last month. </p>", "<p>A similar ban is <a href=\"http://lims.dccouncil.us/Download/41809/B23-0122-HearingNotice1.pdf\">slated for a hearing</a> in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 13.

Mitchell said that in Washington, D.C., nearly a third of residents rely on cash every day because they don't have a card or even a bank account.</p>", "<p>In fact, as cities have cracked down on the cashless economy and spurred new conversations about whom it leaves out, some of the biggest names that tried going cashless \u2014 Amazon's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/22/579640565/amazons-cashier-less-seattle-grocery-opens-to-the-public\">automated convenience store Go </a>and salad chain Sweetgreen \u2014 have reversed their policies in favor of accepting cash. </p>", "<p>\"Going cashless had ... positive results, but it also had the unintended consequence of excluding those who prefer to pay or can only pay with cash,\" Sweetgreen officials wrote <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sweetgreen/back-to-the-future-its-cash-dc1de3da437a\">in a Medium post</a>. </p>", "<p>These reversals show that the market is working to respond to its communities, said National Retail Federation General Counsel Stephanie Martz. She said new laws are \"a solution in search of a problem\" as the number of businesses to go cashless is very small \u2014 in part because each card transaction comes with a fee the business has to pay. </p>", "<p>Credit card companies, which get a cut every time a card is swiped, have rewarded the cashless trend. For example, in 2018, Visa <a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.15521.html\">paid $10,000 each to 50 businesses</a> that stopped accepting cash. </p>", "<p>And some store owners have argued, cash is inefficient. For example, it slows down the line, requires armored cars, and attracts break-ins or skimming by workers. </p>", "<p>And indeed, cash is becoming less popular among U.S. shoppers. The Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/cash/publications/fed-notes/2019/june/2019-findings-from-the-diary-of-consumer-payment-choice/\">found</a> in 2018 that cash had stopped being the No. 1 payment choice \u2014 overtaken by debit cards. </p>", "<p>But cash is still the most common way people pay amounts under $10 or $25 \u2014 especially among those older than 55 and younger than 25. And some people prefer cash for privacy reasons \u2014 to protect their purchase history from being tracked by advertisers or banks.</p>", "<p>Cash also might carry potential psychological and financial benefits for consumers.</p>", "<p>Cash is \"going to feel much more painful to give up because we can see it outflow from our hand,\" said Avni Shah, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Toronto. <a href=\"https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~jrb12/bio/Jim/shah%20eisenkraft%20bettman%20chartrand.pdf\">Her research</a> found that when people pay in cash, they are more mindful of their spending \u2014 willing to spend less to begin with \u2014 but they also value their purchases more and feel more loyal to the seller.</p>", "<p>\"With cash, we can feel this emotional attachment and we value what we have a bit more,\" she said.</p>", "<p>Shah acknowledged that different businesses may have priorities other than loyalty, such as convenience and speed of getting the customer in and out of the store. Opponents of the bans on cashless establishments have argued that businesses should be able to make these decisions for themselves. </p>", "<p>\"We don't think that in five years laws that ban stores from going cashless are going to look smart,\" Martz said, envisioning a near future where everyone has access to digital payments thanks to advances in financial technology. In that future, she argued, banning businesses from going cashless could hamstring them from becoming more efficient.</p>", "<p>But Torres and Mitchell said cashless laws are there to balance technological progress with an economy that's fair and inclusive. </p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

The group urging regulators to act on the Norwegian study, led by government watchdog group Public Citizen, says Congress should use the findings as a roadmap to pass a new law patterned after Europe's tough data privacy rules that took effect in 2018. </p>", "<p>\"These apps and online services spy on people, collect vast amounts of personal data and share it with third parties without people's knowledge.

This Twitter-owned go-between for personal data is controlled by a firm called MoPub. </p>", "<p>\"Grindr only lists Twitter's MoPub as an advertising partner, and encourages users to read the privacy policies of MoPub's own partners to understand how data is used.

A team from Stanford University has gotten one big step closer.</p>", "<p>The team created the PigeonBot \u2014 a winged robot that it says approximates the graceful complexities of bird flight better than any other robot to date.</p>", "<p>When a bird is soaring through the air, it dramatically changes the shape of its wings as it makes hairpin turns and swoops up and down. Birds change the shape of their wings far more than planes do, and the complexities of bird flight have posed a major design challenge for scientists trying to translate the way birds fly into robots.</p>", "<p>Ultimately, the motions that bird wings make are seen as far superior to those of an aircraft: \"It actually enables birds to fly further, longer, maneuver much better,\" says <a href=\"http://lentinklab.stanford.edu/people/1\">David Lentink</a>, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University. \"I really love aircraft as well, but it just doesn't compare to a bird.\"</p>", "<p>Lentink led a team to try to pinpoint some of the unique ways that bird wings work. The researchers then used what they found to create the PigeonBot. They described the robot in a paper published this week <a href=\"http://robotics.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.aay1246\">in Science Robotics</a>.</p>", "<p>The researchers used common pigeon cadavers to try to figure out the mechanics of how birds control the motion of their feathers during flight. Scientists had thought the feathers might be controlled by individual muscles. But they learned that some aspects of bird wing motion are simpler than they expected.</p>", "<p>Lentink says that several doctoral students realized that simply by moving a bird's \"wrist\" and \"finger,\" the feathers would fall into place. When the bird's wrist and finger move, \"all the feathers move too, and they do this automatically,\" he said. \"And that's really cool.\"</p>", "<p>The findings are some of the first evidence that the bird's fingers are important for steering. The team replicated the bird's wing on the PigeonBot using 40 pigeon feathers, springs and rubber bands connected to a wrist and finger structure. When the wrist and finger move, all the feathers move too.</p>", "<p>The researchers used a wind tunnel to see how the feather-and-rubber-band design worked under turbulent conditions. \"Most aerospace engineers would say this is not going to work well, but it turned out to be incredibly robust,\" Lentink says.</p>", "<p>They also pinpointed something interesting about how the feathers work together that helps most birds fly in turbulent conditions. At certain moments during flight, such as when a bird is extending its wings, tiny hooks on the feathers lock together like Velcro.</p>", "<p>\"These tiny, microscopic microstructures that are between feathers lock them together as soon as they separate too far apart and a gap is about to form. And it's really spectacular,\" Lentink adds. \"It requires an enormous force to separate them.\"</p>", "<p>These tiny hooks are so small that they're hard to see even through a microscope. Then, when a bird tucks its wing back in, the feathers unlock automatically, like directional Velcro. Separating the locked feathers makes an audible sound for most birds. The team published this finding in a separate paper <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaz3358\">in the journal Science</a>.</p>", "<p>It's worth noting that the PigeonBot doesn't incorporate something you might associate with birds' wings \u2014 flapping. The designers were focused on incorporating the subtler wrist-and-finger motions of the wings, so the bot appears to be gliding through the air while it's in flight.</p>", "<p>\"The work is very impressive,\" says <a href=\"https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ramezani-alireza/\">Alireza Ramezani</a>, an engineering professor at Northeastern University who recently was part of a team that created a bat-inspired robot.</p>", "<p>He sees it as a sign that drone designs of the future may move away from fixed-wing or rotary-wing technologies. Compared with feathered wings, those harder wings could be dangerous to humans. Softer designs such as this one could be better \"in future smart cities when it comes to close interaction between humans and aerial systems.\"</p>", "<p>Ramezani envisions animal-inspired robots being used in future surveillance or reconnaissance efforts, or maybe even to make package deliveries.</p>", "<p>Lentink says the feather-locking technology that his team discovered could also someday inspire things like high-tech clothing fasteners or specialized bandages.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Second, the reality that each person forms her or his own perceptions about democracy, whether an election is \"rigged\" or whether a fact is reliable.</p>", "<p>Critics faulted the administration of President Barack Obama for keeping quiet through much of 2016 about what it was uncovering about the campaign of active measures that Russia waged that year, including via cyberattacks and with online agitation.</p>", "<p>Pierson said the intelligence community today is conscious about that lesson and appreciates the possibility that it may need to work quicker to decide how and when to reveal information about potential threats. But these decisions aren't simple.</p>", "<p>Intelligence officials need to preserve sources and methods and don't want to needlessly sow more mistrust in democracy, she said.</p>", "<p>\"Some of my colleagues have said, 'maybe we shouldn't necessarily spook the herd and share all this information ...

I think combating that type of activity, again, is a full spectrum of opportunities, which can include technical operations sponsored by the intelligence community, working in close partnership with tech firms and social media firms, and as well as coupled with media literacy.

American officials want Meng sent to the U.S. to face federal fraud charges.</p>", "<p>The Justice Department alleges that Meng fraudulently misled four large banks into processing \"millions of dollars\" worth of financial transactions with Iran in violation of international sanctions. In <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1125021/download\">a 13-count indictment</a> filed against Meng and Huawei in January 2019, the U.S. government says the scheme was conducted through a subsidiary called Skycom, a \"corporation registered in Hong Kong whose primary operations were in Iran.\"</p>", "<p>Meng was apprehended in December 2018 as she changed planes in Vancouver.

When he announced the charges last year, then-acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said Huawei not only lied about its relationship with its subsidiary, but had been working to steal American telecommunications technology. </p>", "<p>Whitaker said Huawei claimed it had sold its Iran-based unit while actually retaining control and ownership of it. As a result, the four unnamed banks doing business with Huawei had inadvertently violated U.S. restrictions on economic activity linked to Iran.</p>", "<p>Meng has denied the Justice Department's allegations. Following her arrest, her attorney, Reid Weingarten, called Meng \"an ethical and honorable businesswoman who has never spent a second of her life plotting to violate any U.S. law.\" </p>", "<p>Huawei has denied violating American laws <a href=\"https://www.huawei.com/en/facts/voices-of-huawei/media-statement-regarding-huawei-cfo-extradition-case-in-canada\">and called Meng's arrest</a> \"an unlawful abuse of process \u2014 one guided by political considerations and tactics, not by the rule of law.\"</p>", "<p>\"We trust in Canada's judicial system, which will prove Ms. Meng's innocence,\" the company said in a statement Monday. \"Huawei stands with Ms. Meng in her pursuit for justice and freedom.\"</p>", "<p>Nonetheless, in March, the Canadian government said the extradition trial<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/01/699451897/canada-says-extradition-hearing-for-huawei-executive-meng-wanzhou-can-proceed\"> could proceed</a>.

As CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-extradition-trial-explained.html\">reports</a>, because Canada does not have economic services sanctions on Iran, Meng's legal team will argue that the nation's extradition laws do not allow for her removal.</p>", "<p>Meng, 47, is not only a top corporate officer at Huawei, but she's also the eldest daughter of its founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei. Huawei has become one of China's most important brands \u2014 and the company is seen by the U.S. government as an avenue by which China exerts global power. That's due, in part, to Huawei's work around the world to build the next generation of 5G wireless networks.</p>", "<p>Huawei has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/01/699307312/huawei-broadens-its-campaign-to-win-over-american-public-and-media\">labored to reshape its image</a> in the U.S., as the Trump administration has argued that the company's phones and technology threaten U.S. national security.</p>", "<p>Meng is free on bail and allowed limited travel but is required to wear a GPS ankle bracelet and have around-the-clock surveillance. She has spent the past year living in one of the two mansions she owns in Vancouver. In May, she was granted approval to move to the larger one \u2014 located on the same block as the U.S. consul general's residence.</p>", "<p>Last month, Huawei <a href=\"https://www.huawei.com/en/facts/voices-of-huawei/your-warmth-is-a-beacon-that-lights-my-way-forward\">published </a>an open letter from Meng on the anniversary of her arrest.</p>", "<p>\"If a busy life has eaten away at my time, then hardship has in turn drawn it back out,\" she wrote, thanking her supporters. \"Right now, time seems to pass slowly. It is so slow that I have enough time to read a book from cover to cover. I can take the time to discuss minutiae with my colleagues or to carefully complete an oil painting.\"</p>", "<p>The first phase of the trial is expected to last about five days, The Associated Press reports. The second phase, set to begin in June, will consider whether the FBI and Canadian police violated Meng's rights by collecting evidence during her detention \u2014 before she was arrested and informed of the crimes she allegedly committed.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

That's a record number, according to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/05/17/technology-use-among-seniors/\">study by the Pew Research Center.</a></p>", "<p>More of these senior citizens are adopting technology, but most also say they need help using new electronic devices such as smart phones. Falling behind on technology puts seniors at risk for social isolation, which makes them vulnerable to poor health and earlier death. It's also expensive. A <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/home-family/friends-family/info-2019/medical-cure-for-loneliness.html\">study by AARP</a> found isolation is associated with nearly $7 billion in additional annual spending by Medicare. </p>", "<p>A startup company in Albuquerque has made matching tech-savvy young people with seniors its mission. <a href=\"https://www.teeniors.com/\">Teeniors</a> coaches them on using smartphones, computers and tablets. </p>", "<p>Founder Trish Lopez pitched the idea at a startup weekend for women entrepreneurs in 2015 after realizing that her mother needed help. </p>", "<p>\"She'd lose a password, she'd lose a document and then she didn't know some simple commands like Control Z that could undo everything she had just done,\" Lopez said. \"And so she would start all over again.\"</p>", "<p>As a new mom herself and busy with work, Lopez said she wanted to be able send someone to help her mother. </p>", "<p>\"But also, I wished I had the patience to help her in the way I wanted to,\" she said.</p>", "<p>Patience and listening are some of the fundamental skills young people learn as Teeniors, and the program has served more than 3,000 seniors in New Mexico. It added a nonprofit arm in 2018 and has landed grants from Comcast and Facebook to serve those who can't afford to pay. The mission, Lopez said, is to empower senior citizens.</p>", "<p>\"I think that's why we've been so successful,\" she said. \"The intergenerational learning experience is really remarkable and that's why I always say the main service we provide is not tech support. It is human connection.\"</p>", "<p>Lopez has seen many Teeniors flourish through those connections. She has also seen many seniors break down when a Teenior helps them understand technology that seemed beyond their comprehension. </p>", "<p>That was certainly true for Camilla Dorcey, 76. She was talking to a friend recently in her home in northeast Albuquerque about a new car she was getting that day. But not long ago, that routine task was beyond her, said Dorcey who at one time struggled using her smartphone.</p>", "<p>\"People would be ringing me and I didn't know how to answer it,\" Dorcey said. \"I'd be crying and frustrated and feeling totally useless and old.\"</p>", "<p>The Pew study found that 4 in 10 seniors own smartphones, but they often lack confidence in learning and using these devices. Dorcey is a retired teacher from Lesotho, Africa, who lived all over the world before moving to Albuquerque with her second husband. When he died suddenly, she was left alone and isolated, too ashamed to admit she didn't know how to answer her new phone. She tried to get help at stores, but clerks were mystified why she was confused.</p>", "<p>\"They said 'Oh a child' \u2014 I hate that phrase \u2014 'a child could do this,\" Dorcey said. \"But they never gave me a child.'</p>", "<p>Dorcey found a Teenior instead, who helped her download WhatsApp. Now she talks to family and friends regularly in Africa and Europe for free. On the last day of 2019, she greeted friends in England enthusiastically over the app, wishing them a happy new year.</p>", "<p>\"Oh it's amazing,\" Dorcey said. \"I can see them. I can talk to them. It's really been great. I feel free again.\"</p>", "<p>Tess Reynolds, 17, is the Teenior who helped Dorcey. Reynolds said she can relate to seniors who may need more time to learn because she has a learning disability and people used to push her to finish her schoolwork more quickly.</p>", "<p>\"So I know how it feels to be rushed,\" Reynolds said. \"I want to make sure that doesn't happen.\"</p>", "<p>The experience of working for Teeniors has also convinced Reynolds that she wants to become a senior home health aide. </p>", "<p>\"And this is such a great help to really become what you want to be,\" she said.</p>", "<p>At a Teeniors event in December at a senior center about 40 minutes south of Albuquerque, 21-year-old Kendra Gonzales was helping Linda Haverty add a photo of a friend to her contacts list. </p>", "<p>\"I went from a flip top to this. It was like going from a tank to a Ferrari,\" said Haverty, who is 81. \"And the next time it was Facebook. I'm still struggling with social media. And Kendra's wonderful.\"</p>", "<p>Haverty's family is scattered around the Midwest and she said keeping up on technology is vital to staying connected to them.</p>", "<p>\"Yesterday I was going through Facebook and found out I have a great-grandson that was born on my birthday...and I didn't know about it,\" she said.</p>", "<p>Gonzales has been with Teeniors for four years. It helped her land jobs and decide on a career in public service. She's working toward a criminal justice degree, and through Teeniors she learned skills such as public speaking and coaching.</p>", "<p>\"[I learned] things that I don't think the school system helped me with,\" Gonzales said. \"This has helped me more, in a great way.\"</p>", "<p>Trish Lopez never anticipated how Teeniors would affect the young people she employs. It's not just teaching them tech skills, but also soft skills employers need such as emotional intelligence, problem-solving and communication. Their feedback has surprised her.</p>", "<p>\"Some of them believe it's helped them overcome their depression and anxiety and struggles in their personal relationships,\" she said. \"Just the work of being a Teenior, for the small amount of hours they do it every month, has made an enormous impact on their lives.\"</p>", "<p>Yannick Hutchinson, 24, just graduated with an architecture degree and said being part of Teeniors will help him learn to communicate better with clients. It also helped when he was struggling with depression.</p>", "<p>\"It was definitely something that pulled me back from that dark, dark area,\" he said. \"It was nice, it was a breath of fresh air.\"</p>", "<p>Lopez had considered dropping him from the coaching pool after he was late several times and that's when Hutchinson opened up about his struggles.</p>", "<p>\"We definitely worked it out and I definitely feel I'm more of an asset to this organization now,\" he said. \"I need to understand I'm being counted on by people and I need to be responsible for that.\"</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://aese.psu.edu/extension/intergenerational/program-areas/technology/using-technology-to-connect-generations-profiles#page=3\">Variations of the Teeniors model</a> exist around the country, according to <a href=\"https://www.gu.org/\">Generations United</a>, based in Washington, D.C. Executive Director Donna Butts said intergenerational programs offer alternatives to our tendency to segregate people by age.</p>", "<p>\"We really are much stronger when we're together and value the wisdom of older adults and the energy and new experience of young people,\" she said. </p>", "<p>Butts adds that since America's older generation is disproportionately white compared to the younger population, there are real risks to such segregation.</p>", "<p>\"And that can be really, really harmful when we have generations that don't look like each other, they don't know each other and they don't understand why they need to invest in each other,\" she said.</p>", "<p>She said intergenerational programs can overcome those barriers. That was certainly true for Camilla Dorcey.</p>", "<p>\"I think Teeniors are maybe seeing old people as not totally ready to be put in the grave,\" she said. \"For me, it's making me think teenagers should not all be in jail.

The company says its latest funding round has brought in $161 million in new investment.</p>", "<p>\"People thought this was all science fiction\" when the company was founded back in 2015, Uma Valeti, the co-founder and CEO of Memphis Meats, told NPR in an interview at the company's headquarters. \"Everything that we've done at Memphis Meats [has] started to show that this can be done,\" Valeti said. \"This is real.\"</p>", "<p>Interest in cell-based meat production and other meat alternatives has increased amid growing awareness of the environmental impact of traditional livestock agriculture.</p>", "<p>Valeti and his team walked us through the process of producing cell-based meat. It starts with the selection of specific types of animal cells that can grow to become meat. Next, the cells are fed and put in a \"cultivator\" \u2014 similar to a fermenting tank \u2014 where they can grow and form muscle and connective tissue. The process is analogous to the way breweries grow yeast cells to produce beer. Only here, they're growing animal cells.</p>", "<p>\n                Memphis Meats CEO Uma Valeti (right) stands with Morgan Rease, the company's formulations scientist, while they cook up a sample of cell-based chicken.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Allison Aubrey/NPR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Memphis Meats CEO Uma Valeti (right) stands with Morgan Rease, the company's formulations scientist, while they cook up a sample of cell-based chicken.</p>", "<p>I got the chance to sample Memphis Meats' chicken, which was pan-saut\u00e9ed with some oil and served with greens. It tasted pretty close to chicken breast produced the traditional way \u2014 but without as much textural variation among bits of muscle, fat and connective tissue. The pilot production facility, which is expected to be built in the next 18 to 24 months, will allow the company to scale up and experiment with its meat products, which also include duck and beef.</p>", "<p>But Memphis Meats and its competitors face quite a few hurdles in bringing cell-based meats to market. For starters, the cost of production needs to come down. Back in 2018, <em>Wired</em> reported that a<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-high-cost-of-lab-to-table-meat/\"> pound of Memphis Meats takes $2,400 to produce</a>, in part because of the expensive growth mediums \u2014 or feed \u2014 needed to culture cells.</p>", "<p>\"Our costs have continued to come down significantly over the last three years,\" Valeti told us in an email Wednesday. \"We have a clear path to bringing a cost competitive product to market as we scale our production and that's part of what our latest funding round will help us to unlock,\" Valeti said. He said the company will continue to work on developing low-cost feed for the cells, which is one significant piece of the puzzle.</p>", "<p>Decisions over how best to label, regulate and inspect cell-based meats are another challenge. In late 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the two agencies would <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-usda-secretary-perdue-and-fda-commissioner-gottlieb-regulation-cell-cultured-food-products\">share regulatory oversight</a>, but there are still many issues to resolve.</p>", "<p>\"The agencies have outlined a path to market, Valeti said, \"and we will continue providing them with the information they need to fill in the details.\"</p>", "<p>Memphis Meats has plenty of competitors in the space, and some of them are <a href=\"https://www.gfi.org/non-cms-pages/splash-sites/soi-reports/files/SOI-Report-Cell-Based.pdf\">seeking regulatory approval outside the United States</a>. As of last year, there were<a href=\"https://www.gfi.org/non-cms-pages/splash-sites/soi-reports/files/SOI-Report-Cell-Based.pdf\"> 27 cell-based meat and seafood companies around the world</a>, according to the Good Food Institute.

That will be the way people are caught if they log in to the system under false pretenses and try to vote as someone else.</p>", "<p>The King County elections office plans to print out the ballots submitted electronically by voters whose signatures match and count the papers alongside the votes submitted through traditional routes.</p>", "<p>While advocates say this creates an auditable paper trail, many security experts say that because the ballots cross the Internet before they are printed, any subsequent audits on them would be moot. If a cyberattack occurred, an audit could essentially require double-checking ballots that may already have been altered, says Buell.</p>", "<p>\"If you're doing phone voting or Internet voting, it's pretty much 'garbage in, garbage out.' You don't really know what you're getting in or what's coming out the other side,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the former chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, in an interview with NPR last year.</p>", "<p>Voters who use the smartphone portal also have the option to not submit their ballots electronically. They can log in, fill out the ballot and then print it to either drop off at designated drop-off locations or put in the mail.</p>", "<p><strong>Glimpse of the future?</strong></p>", "<p>Voting online has had a bumpy history over the past decade.</p>", "<p>In a widely publicized incident, Washington, D.C., saw an online voting pilot program <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/debonis/2010/10/hacker_infiltration_ends_dc_on.html\">get hacked in 2010</a>.

Private tech companies are increasingly taking the lead in reporting information about suspected attacks by foreign actors. In some cases, the companies sell their reports to the U.S. intelligence community.</p>", "<p>The U.S. government says it's on high alert for cyberattacks from foreign countries in this election year. Yet private cybersecurity firms have often been the ones sounding the alarm, and in some cases, they are selling their services to the U.S. intelligence community.</p>", "<p>\"We've seen Iran impersonating political candidates,\" said <a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/executive-perspective/2019/10/sandra-joyce-cyber-security-in-2020-and-beyond.html\">Sandra Joyce</a>, the head of global intelligence at FireEye, a leading cybersecurity company.</p>", "<p>\"They've even fabricated letters that look like they're coming from concerned citizens. They get themselves published in newspapers. Well-known newspapers. But they're influence operators from Iran. They're not concerned citizens from Texas,\" she added.</p>", "<p>Whether it's Iran, Russia or other foreign actors, cybersecurity companies and research groups have been often been more public than the government in identifying potential foreign threats.</p>", "<p>\"The government doesn't have a monopoly on tracking, identifying or exposing some of these vulnerabilities,\" said <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/graham-brookie/\">Graham Brookie</a>, who runs the <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/digital-forensic-research-lab/\">Digital Forensic Research Lab</a> at the Atlantic Council in Washington. \"The threat is evolving and threats are becoming more diffuse, more complex and in some ways more open.\"</p>", "<p>The U.S. government says it welcomes help from tech companies, according to Shelby Pierson, who works for the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire. She was appointed last year to a newly created position that puts her in charge of coordinating election security across the intelligence community. </p>", "<p>\"There is a whole consortium of players in this landscape which include private security firms,\" Pierson told NPR in an interview. \"Those organizations will actually have deeper and technical insight into those networks before the intelligence community will. </p>", "<p>\"Pierson said the government sometimes buys services from cybersecurity companies, and she cited a couple of the biggest players in the industry. </p>", "<p>\"FireEye and CrowdStrike, for example, have done really good work, where based on the analysis, expertise and information analysis that they do, those are products and services that they can sell to the U.S. government.\"</p>", "<p>The cyber firm <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/14/796195444/russia-hacked-company-linked-to-trump-impeachment-security-firm-says\">Area 1 Security</a> said it recently detected Russian military intelligence breaking into the computer systems of Burisa. That's the Ukranian gas company where Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, used to be on the board.</p>", "<p>This raised suspicions that the Russians are looking for dirt on the Bidens.</p>", "<p>Area 1 has received a lot of media attention for this report \u2014 which is good for a private company. However, the tight-lipped U.S. intelligence community hasn't offered its own assessment.</p>", "<p>So what's the government's position on the report \u2014 does it agree, disagree, or just prefer to remain silent?</p>", "<p>\"Of course, these topics are news and newsworthy,\" said Brookie, of the Atlantic Council. But he warned that we're going to see a wide range of opinions on how much public attention a potential threat should receive. </p>", "<p>Tech companies have incentives to publicize threats they've uncovered. The media is looking for scoops. Yet the government might be inclined to say little or nothing.</p>", "<p>\"And we, collectively between government and media and tech have not shown that we know what to do with that,\" Brookie said.</p>", "<p>The government is wrestling with the issue, said Pierson.</p>", "<p>\"Some of my [government] colleagues have said, 'Maybe we shouldn't necessarily spook the herd and share all this information,'\" she said. \"Maybe people go, 'You know what, this is all rigged. That's so much disinformation. I'm not going to vote.' That would be worst case scenario. And frankly, doing the work of our adversaries for them.\"</p>", "<p>However, a number of government agencies have pledged to be more open than in the past.

But, Green says, \"the bad thing about being Jeff Bezos is that there are a lot of people with huge amounts of money who want to hack you.\"</p>", "<p>Still, a targeted hack like the one <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/798457906/u-n-experts-urge-probe-of-reported-hacking-of-jeff-bezos-phone-by-saudi-arabia?utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=storiesfromnpr\">the Saudis allegedly used against Bezos</a> to get troves of information off his phone \u2014 which involved a video file allegedly sent by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Bezos over WhatsApp \u2014 is costly and hard to pull off, says Green, an expert on cryptography and cybersecurity.</p>", "<p>Green says that if you're not very wealthy and not a celebrity, a politician or a top executive, \"you probably are not a target.\" At least for that type of attack.</p>", "<p>That's the good news. The not-so-good news: Research shows that more general-purpose malware aimed at phones that the rest of us use is also <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/mobile-threat-report-2019-trends-and-recommendations/\">on the rise</a>.</p>", "<p>So here's what you need to know to reduce your chances of getting hacked.</p>", "<p>There is a whole netherworld of questionable apps that exists outside the supported app stores run by Apple, Google and Amazon.</p>", "<p>Many people \"jailbreak,\" or alter, their phones so they can install apps from outside the mainstream app stores \u2014 apps that look like games or promise to let you watch a big Hollywood blockbuster before it's officially released. But \"that dramatically increases your risk for installing malicious apps,\" says Tim Erlin, a cybersecurity expert at Tripwire.</p>", "<p>Overall, phones are getting much harder for hackers to break into, Green says. He says even if your phone is compromised in some way by malicious code, that doesn't mean the hackers can open all your apps, look inside them and get your bank account numbers, emails with your tax returns for your accountant or whatever else.</p>", "<p>\"Every single app you have runs in what's called a sandbox. Basically, it's isolated from all the other apps on the phone,\" Green says. \"So even if there's a bug in one app ... that could lead to something bad \u2014 some malware being installed that affects that app. But generally speaking, it won't spread throughout your phone.\"</p>", "<p>So that's a crucial protection to make hacks much more difficult. But if you jailbreak your phone, you're throwing aside that digital security and leaving yourself much more vulnerable.</p>", "<p>Green notes that if your phone is four or five years old, you also don't have some of these important newer protections and are more at risk.</p>", "<p>Hackers and the phone manufacturers are in an ongoing race. The hackers find vulnerabilities, and then fixes are included in the software updates for your phone.</p>", "<p>Social media and messaging companies are in this race against the hackers too. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, warned about and fixed <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2019-11931\">a video file vulnerability</a> last year, but <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/bezos-phone-hack-mbs-saudi-arabia/\">it's unclear</a> whether it was the same one that allowed Bezos' iPhone to be hacked in 2018. Where you play a role in all this is by installing the latest updates to your phone and the apps installed on it.</p>", "<p>\"Keeping your phone updated is an important step in keeping it secure as well,\" Erlin says. \"It's important to install those updates when they're available.\"</p>", "<p>This is where having an old phone can be a problem. \"It's a choice you can make: If you don't want to move to a newer phone, you want to accept that risk. Lots of people do, but it does put you at greater risk, because you're no longer receiving security updates,\" Erlin says.</p>", "<p>In traditional <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams\">phishing attempts</a>, you might get an email on your computer asking you to click on a link or download a file that contains malware. But for hackers targeting phones, the threat might not be in an email.</p>", "<p>\"If you think about the apps that you use most commonly, maybe it's Facebook, maybe it's Instagram, maybe it's some other app where you have the capability to send and receive messages,\" Erlin says. \"An example would be that in Instagram, you receive a link. Maybe it's not a file \u2014 maybe it's a link from someone you know or you follow that says, 'Here, I made this for you.' \"</p>", "<p>Just like with email phishing accounts, Erlin says, watch out for vague and general-sounding messages asking you to open a file or click on a link. Even if the message comes from someone you know, the person's account may have been compromised. \"And so you click on that link and it compromises your phone,\" Erlin says.</p>", "<p>Be careful about being tricked into giving away passwords or other sensitive personal or financial information. Erlin remembers a couple of years ago, an attacker was trying to get people to enter their credentials for their bank account so the hackers could steal them.</p>", "<p>Erlin adds: \"And they had compromised the phone in such a way that they replaced the phone number for the bank account with a phone number that they controlled, so that when you tried to call your bank to say, 'Hey, I can't get into my bank account,' you ended up with a person who was associated with this attack. That's a fairly sophisticated type of operation, but it was possible at that time.\"</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/25/773199525/sim-swap-scams-expose-risks-of-using-phones-for-secondary-i-d\">SIM-swap scams</a> are some of the scariest phone hacks. They're more difficult and time intensive to pull off. So they're not that common, but they are on the rise.</p>", "<p>Samy Tarazi, a criminal investigator with the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office in California, works on a regional task force on the problem. He says he knows of about 4,000 cases nationally, \"but there are more than that.\"</p>", "<p>With a SIM swap, fraudsters take control of a victim's phone number. Tarazi says there are multiple ways they can do this. They might trick the phone company and claim they lost their phone and need to transfer the number. Sometimes it's an inside job where they bribe a phone company employee.</p>", "<p>Once they get that number transferred over to a phone that the hackers control, Tarazi says, often \"that phone number is linked to all of the victim's online accounts \u2014 their bank accounts.\"</p>", "<p>Those accounts use the cellphone number to verify a customer's identity when the customer wants to do something like change a password. A bank might send you a text message with a temporary code that you then use to change your account's password.</p>", "<p>So without knowing any of your actual passwords, a hacker can take control of an email account and then have control of both your phone number and your email. \"From there, he can reset passwords to any other service \u2014 banks, cryptocurrency ... social media,\" Tarazi says. People have lost large sums of money this way, he says.</p>", "<p>But Tarazi says there is a way to protect yourself: \"We highly recommend that people not use their cellphone number as a form of verification of identity.\" Instead, he says, you should tell financial institutions and other services that you use that you want to use a password and some other form of two-step verification. </p>", "<p>Tarazi says some companies may allow you to use a special authenticator app for this. Or he says you could use security questions that you know the answer to. But he says you should make up fictional answers if the security questions can be researched and figured out by others.</p>", "<p>This is actually an area where phones are getting more secure. Green says if you're running a relatively new phone with the most updated operating system, you don't have to worry that much about whether plugging into a public charging station or connecting to a public Wi-Fi network is going to let hackers break into your phone.</p>", "<p>\"There's still always a chance that somebody could look at the traffic going over the network. You should worry about that,\" Green says. \"But really, hacking into your phone is getting much, much harder.\"</p>", "<p>But Tarazi says you do want to be more careful when traveling abroad. He says many people want to use Wi-Fi to avoid roaming charges, and that's OK.</p>", "<p>But, he says, be careful if you try to use a public network and it prompts you to do something suspicious. \"Sometimes it's download this app and then use it to log in,\" Tarazi says. \"If it ever requires you to download something, definitely do not do that.\"</p>", "<p>Even with the improved security for smartphones, often you don't realize you've been hacked until it's too late. And if somebody opens a credit card in your name or steals money from an account, you also don't know how they got your personal information \u2014 from your phone, stealing your mail or <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/22/744050565/equifax-to-pay-up-to-700-million-in-data-breach-settlement\">the Equifax breach</a> or some other massive hack of a corporation.</p>", "<p>If the address book on your phone is compromised, an attacker would be able to email spam with malicious links to all your contacts. If one of those contacts clicks on the link and then does some online banking, \"that lets the hackers steal credentials for their bank account and then they have access to that bank account,\" Erlin says.</p>", "<p>Tarazi of the Santa Clara DA's office says that with so many ways to have your personal financial information stolen, it's a good idea to call the three major credit bureaus and tell them to <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs\">put a freeze on your credit report</a>. That makes it much harder for identity thieves to open a new bank account or credit card using your name.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Here, Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is seen visiting Congress for a hearing last October.</p>", "<p>Facebook says it will continue to allow political ads that target the social media platform's users, sticking to its position despite concerns about the potential impact on the upcoming presidential election. Federal Election Commissioner Ellen Weintraub sharply criticized the policy, saying Facebook's \"weak plan suggests the company has no idea how seriously it is hurting democracy.\"</p>", "<p>Facebook's policy falls short of measures recently taken by other tech giants. Google says it will limit the ability of political ads to target an audience, and Twitter has banned political ads entirely.</p>", "<p>Taking aim at Facebook's policy in a series of tweets Thursday morning, Weintraub, a Democrat, said, \"I am not willing to bet the 2020 elections on the proposition that Facebook has solved its problems with a solution whose chief feature appears to be that it doesn't seriously impact the company's profit margins.\"</p>", "<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Facebook</a>\u2019s weak plan suggests the company has no idea how seriously it is hurting democracy. <br><br>No one is a bigger believer in transparency than I. But here, proposing \u2018transparency\u2019 solutions is window-dressing when Facebook needs to be putting out the housefire it has lit. <br>/1 <a href=\"https://t.co/0fSJbAGt6C\">https://t.co/0fSJbAGt6C</a></p>", "<p>Facebook also says it's not changing how it handles the content of ads. While the company says its community standards bar hate speech and harmful content, <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/01/political-ads/\">the policy announced Thursday</a> does not address calls from those who want the company to fact-check ads before it publishes them. <em>(Note: Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters.)</em></p>", "<p>In announcing the policy Thursday, Facebook's director of product management, Rob Leathern, wrote that \"people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public.\"</p>", "<p>Facebook says it shouldn't be in the business of fact-checking, that the U.S. needs new laws to govern political speech on social media \u2014 and to a degree, the American Civil Liberties Union agrees.</p>", "<p>\"This will not be a popular view. But on the whole, we think that Facebook got this right,\" says Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.</p>", "<p>Describing the gray area that political ads often occupy, Wizner added, \"I don't think Facebook is capable of doing effective fact-checking, and I don't think as a society we should want Facebook to be the entity that's making those kinds of distinctions.\"</p>", "<p>Part of the issue, he says, is the massive scale of political ads \u2014 not only at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S., but also in every country in which Facebook operates. Wizner predicts that if Facebook took up fact-checking in earnest, it would be inundated with demands from candidates and political campaigns that want the other side's ads taken down, rather than responding to them in public.</p>", "<p>A different take comes from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the online civil rights group, which accused Facebook of exempting politicians from the rules it applies to everyone else.</p>", "<p>In  a statement sent to NPR, Gennie Gebhart, the EFF's associate director of research, said, \"Facebook readily and pervasively plays the role of speech referee for the general public, but, concerned about playing politics, applies a more permissive set of rules to powerful political groups complaining about bias.\"</p>", "<p>Despite backing part of Facebook's revised policy, the ACLU's Wizner agrees with critics who say the company should change how it handles targeted political advertising.</p>", "<p>\"There is something different about online microtargeted advertisements and the kind of political advertisements that we've mainly seen in the past, on radio and television,\" he says. With targeted ad campaigns, he adds, \"it's possible for candidates to send one advertisement to me and a different one to my neighbor across the street. And so that makes it easier for lies to go uncorrected.\"</p>", "<p>Among the changes Wizner would like to see: more information from Facebook about which users have been targeted with political ads, so misleading information can be rebutted.</p>", "<p>\"If a candidate is going to run an ad that goes only to men in one neighborhood, or only to women in another, then we should know who the target audience was,\" he says. \"So that if the ad contains falsehoods, we know how to better target our responses and corrections. And Facebook should consider raising the minimum number of targeted audience members for ads \u2014 so that we're dealing with a more common political conversation, and not a different one for each household.\"</p>", "<p>The FEC's Weintraub has urged tech companies to take an aggressive stand against microtargeting potential voters with ads. In an opinion piece for <em>The Washington Post</em> last November, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/01/dont-abolish-political-ads-social-media-stop-microtargeting/\">Weintraub wrote</a>, \"Microtargeting by foreign and domestic actors in 2016 proved to be a potent weapon for spreading disinformation and sowing discord.\"</p>", "<p>Facebook promises that its approach will bring \"unprecedented transparency and control for political ads.\" The company plans to add a new control in early summer that will let users cut down on the number of political and social issue ads they see, on both Facebook and Instagram. Its users can also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1665333080167380?id=176276233019487\">search its Ad Library</a> for details such as the size of an ad's audience, and where those people live.</p>", "<p>\"The expanded transparency features will roll out in the first quarter of 2020 and will apply in all countries where we facilitate 'Paid for by' disclaimers on ads,\" Facebook says.</p>", "<p>But those solutions don't satisfy critics who say the platform's users still won't be able to opt out completely and block all political ads.

Though home to about 20% of the world's population, and despite every major label and concert promoter maintaining an office there, virtually no Chinese acts have broken into the mainstream at the same level as other regional-turned-global genres, like K-pop and m\u00fasica urbana. (There are several potential reasons for this gap \u2014 from perceived language barriers, to <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/business/8496661/outdustry-china-recorded-music-industry-challenges-streaming\">metadata and payment challenges</a> for artists and songwriters, to Chinese <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/provisions-on-the-governance-of-the-online-information-content-ecosystem/\">regulations</a> with murky criteria around what constitutes acceptable content.)</p>", "<p>But that doesn't mean China is absent from the <em>business</em> of music. Quite the opposite: While the country may not be churning out global hits, its tech conglomerates are financially participating in the global operations that make those hits possible.</p>", "<p>On New Year's Eve 2019, it was <a href=\"https://www.vivendi.com/en/press/press-releases/vivendi-signing-of-the-agreement-with-a-tencent-led-consortium-regarding-umg-and-the-evolution-of-its-capital/\">announced</a> that Chinese tech behemoth Tencent Holdings would lead a consortium of investors to purchase a collective 10% stake in Universal Music, the world's dominant record label group and the parent company to Capitol Records, Blue Note and Republic, among many others. Vivendi, parent company of Universal Music, first announced its intentions to offload a portion of the company <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/634045551/french-media-giant-vivendi-announces-plans-to-sell-half-of-universal-music-group\">in 2018</a>. (The deal has yet to be approved \u2014 Vivendi, parent company to Universal Music, expects it to be finalized within the first half of 2020.)</p>", "<p>Tencent Holdings owns China's biggest music company, Tencent Music Entertainment, which controls roughly <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1990254/tencent-merge-qq-music-service-china-music-corp-create-streaming\">60%</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42085acc-1d00-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6\">70%</a> of the local music market and itself owns shares in many high-profile global music ventures. In fact, just over two years ago, Tencent Music and Spotify announced an unusual <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/spotify-tencent-share-swap/\">equity-swap agreement</a>, in which the two companies purchased a roughly 9% stake in each other's businesses. (While Spotify is available in nearly 80 markets, China is not currently one of them.)</p>", "<p>Tencent Music also operates the Chinese music-streaming apps QQ Music, Kugou and Kuwo, as well as karaoke app WeSing. According to the company's latest <a href=\"https://ir.tencentmusic.com/2019-11-11-Tencent-Music-Entertainment-Group-Announces-Third-Quarter-2019-Unaudited-Financial-Results\">earnings report</a>, its three music-streaming products attracted over 661 million mobile monthly active users in the third quarter of 2019. Only around 5% of those users paid for a subscription, yet the company is still profitable, because it makes over 70% of its revenue from \"social entertainment services\" such as <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/tencent-music-uses-tipping-to-rack-up-revenues-why-arent-western-music-streaming-platforms-doing-the-same/\">tipping</a> and other forms of in-app \"virtual gifts\" \u2014 which are commonplace on Chinese social-media platforms, though rare in the Western streaming landscape.</p>", "<p>(Legally and literally speaking, it's somewhat insufficient to refer to Tencent Music as simply a \"Chinese\" company, because it's incorporated in the Cayman Islands, just like its parent company, and trades publicly on the New York Stock Exchange.) </p>", "<p>Tencent's emergence as one of the most powerful players in music brings new clarity to the exact nature of the industry's globalization. But why would Tencent want to diversify into the label business? It certainly has a large-enough audience, to the tune of hundreds of millions of monthly active users, as well as more than enough cash to keep afloat. </p>", "<p>The most likely answer is direct access to intellectual property and talent \u2014 combining music creation, marketing, distribution and consumption into one business. Tencent Music may have the technological prowess to maintain its apps, but needs a bit more help when it comes to artist marketing and creative development.</p>", "<p>That's where Universal Music comes in. To clarify, Tencent's equity stake in Universal does not mean that the former owns any of the latter's copyrights \u2014 it simply means that Tencent gets to share in a part of Universal's future financial growth, which certainly does correlate to the <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/universal-music-group-posts-2bn-in-q3-2019-revenues/\">rising value</a> of the label's catalog, spanning artists from Billie Eilish to J Balvin and Queen. Importantly, this contradicts one of the most widespread music-tech narratives of the past five years, that streaming companies want to <em>decrease</em> their reliance on major labels (and vice versa) in order to improve their bottom lines.</p>", "<p>In a world where no one can quite agree on whether <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2017/06/21/why-content-will-always-always-king/#29c6f692eb37\">content</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/7/13/content-isnt-king\">tech</a> is king, streaming services and music rights-owners are actually more tethered to each other than ever \u2014 and Tencent's deals with Universal and Spotify arguably put paid to the possibility of independence for <em>any</em> of these stakeholders.</p>", "<p>To wit: Tencent Holdings, Tencent Music and other investors own a 10% stake in Universal Music Group, while Tencent Music and Spotify own around a 9% stake in each other. But let's not forget that the two other major labels, Sony Music and Warner Music, also collectively own around a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/tencent-music-ipo-sony-warner-music-shares-1202965749/\">4%</a> stake in Tencent Music. And Universal Music and Sony Music <em>also</em> own stakes in Spotify, around <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/sony-has-cashed-in-50-of-its-spotify-shares-generating-around-750m/\">3%</a> to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/spotify-at-days-close-what-are-sony-warner-and-universals-shares-worth-a-lot-1202743146/\">4%</a> each.</p>", "<p>\n                Pony Ma Huateng, chairman and chief executive officer of Tencent Holdings Ltd., giving a speech during the China International Big Data Industry Expo on May 28, 2018 in Guiyang, Guizhou Province, China.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    VCG/VCG via Getty Images\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p>What complicates this web even more is that Tencent Music has the exclusive right to broker licensing deals for the catalogs of all three major labels (Universal, Warner and Sony) in China, which effectively gives it oversight of the domestic music market by sublicensing these vast catalogs to its competitors \u2014 like Alibaba, NetEase, ByteDance and Baidu.</p>", "<p>To better understand this situation, imagine a world where Spotify had the exclusive right to distribute all the major labels' catalog in the U.S. In this world, if Apple Music or Amazon Music wanted to feature, say, Billie Eilish's catalog on their platforms, they would have to go to Spotify, not Billie's label (Universal-owned Interscope Records), to legally offer their customers her songs.</p>", "<p>This scenario would probably be short-lived, thanks to antitrust protections. Indeed, federal antitrust authorities in China are currently <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-27/watchdog-probes-tencent-s-grip-on-china-s-giant-music-industry\">investigating</a> Tencent Music's exclusive deals with the majors \u2014 though some <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/business/8496661/outdustry-china-recorded-music-industry-challenges-streaming\">argue</a> that those arrangements have allowed Tencent Music to play a proactive, impactful role in helping to curb piracy in the country and grow the local music economy overall.</p>", "<p>Moreover, to revisit the fact that Spotify is not available in China: It's practically impossible for any company to establish an online presence in the country without getting some sort of approval from the national government's censorship arm, which includes but is not limited to obtaining an <a href=\"https://www.quantil.com/content-delivery-insights/icp-certification-china/\">Internet Content Provider (ICP) license</a>. This further strengthens Tencent's leverage, and weeds out most international competition. (<a href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/culture/disney-wont-be-streaming-china-any-time-soon/article/3037550\">Disney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/netflix-has-a-china-strategy-it-doesnt-involve-launching-there-soon.html\">Netflix</a> faced similar challenges with their respective streaming services last year; the latter has opted to license their own content to Chinese-owned platforms, instead of launching in the country directly.)</p>", "<p>With the largest paid-subscriber base, Spotify understandably dominates much of the global industry conversation about music streaming. But the rise of Tencent underscores how Spotify is actually the exception, not the rule, when it comes to streaming's future.</p>", "<p>Spotify is what industry insiders call a \"pure-play\" streaming service \u2014 i.e., one that makes its money purely from music and audio consumption, probably via advertising or monthly subscriptions. Other examples of pure-play services include Pandora, Tidal and Deezer, none of which are even close to having Spotify's global reach and user numbers. Even Spotify itself faces financial challenges in its overreliance on licensing music from third parties, having been profitable for only two quarters out of its entire 12-year existence.</p>", "<p>In contrast, non-pure-play streaming platforms \u2014 like Apple Music, Amazon Music and Google-owned YouTube \u2014 have the safety net of multibillion-dollar tech corporations behind them. Such services don't have as much of a pressure to turn a profit, and in fact exist primarily to increase sales in their parent companies' core businesses (e.g. Apple Music drives loyalty to iPhones; Amazon Music drives sales of Amazon Prime and smart speakers; YouTube drives Google's ad revenue).</p>", "<p>For Tencent, like its stateside peers, music is just a drop in the bucket, one amongst its <a href=\"https://technode.com/2019/02/20/tencent-invested-700-companies/\">hundreds</a> of other businesses and investments.</p>", "<p>Aside from controlling most of China's music market, Tencent Holdings also owns WeChat and QQ, two of China's biggest social and messaging platforms. Its gaming subsidiary, Tencent Games, owns Riot Games (<em>League of Legends</em>) and has stakes in Epic Games (<em>Fortnite</em>), Ubisoft (<em>Assassin's Creed</em>) and Activision Blizzard (<em>Call of Duty</em>). All in all, the conglomerate invested in a total of \"<a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/31/tencents-investment-strategy-cools-off.aspx\">only</a>\" 108 companies across media, entertainment, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3018339/tencent-steps-expansion-india-investment-fintech-start-niyo\">fintech</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tencent-to-invest-in-educational-startup-vipkid-11568862463\">education</a> in 2019, which was actually a 33% drop in activity year-over-year. Music is just one of many layers atop this sprawling ecosystem.</p>", "<p>Tencent Holdings' diversification has given Tencent Music the wiggle room to pull off what Spotify has yet to accomplish, <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/8497377/spotify-gimlet-anchor-podcasts-marketplace-analysis-music\">at least on the music side</a>: profiting from both a digital audience and the talent entertaining it. (In fact, long before its Universal Music deal, Tencent Music launched its own joint-venture record label with Sony Music called <a href=\"http://www.liquidstate.co/\">Liquid State</a>, which promotes electronic artists from across the Asian diaspora.)</p>", "<p>Owning a part of Universal Music and Spotify could potentially enable Tencent to expand this vertical-integration philosophy beyond its own domestic apps, and establish a large footprint in Western markets. And if the music industry in 2020 is inseparable from Chinese money, it's only a matter of time before Chinese talent follows suit.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Interestingly, while Adele had the two best-<em>selling</em> albums of the decade \u2014 <em>21</em> and <em>25</em>, respectively, both released in 2015 or earlier \u2014 she's nowhere to be found on any decade-end streaming charts.</p>", "<p>In general, music listening is accelerating: According to BuzzAngle, last year's streams alone accounted for more than 30% of all streaming activity over the past six years. But beneath the \"one trillion streams\" headlines are some deeper truths about the current state of the music business \u2014 some of which reflect the industry's stubborn resistance to change, and others of which provide a sign of the global transformation to come.</p>", "<p><strong>Audio streams might rule the U.S., but video streams rule the world</strong></p>", "<p>Audio-streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music tend to suck up much of the air when talking about the modern music industry, at least in the U.S. But zoom out to a global level and it's actually video \u2014 not audio \u2014 that reigns supreme.</p>", "<p>Nielsen Music and BuzzAngle both found that audio accounted for around 70% of total on-demand streams in the U.S. in 2019, with video comprising the remaining 30%. But Nielsen's worldwide streaming data flips that ratio on its head: Out of the 5.1 trillion on-demand music streams generated globally in 2019, including U.S. plays, 66% came from video, while the remaining 33% came from audio.</p>", "<p>This is because YouTube is the preferred consumption platform and marketing machine for several international music genres, from <a href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/cheriehu42/issues/why-are-none-of-the-top-10-music-video-debuts-in-youtube-history-from-hip-hop-artists-173643\">K-pop</a> in Korea to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/world/asia/t-series-youtube-india.html\">Bollywood</a> in India (YouTube alone accounts for <a href=\"https://www.musicplus.in/indian-music-industry-cross-%E2%82%B919-2-billion-2021/\">40%</a> of Indian labels' revenues). Unlike Spotify Premium or Apple Music, YouTube is free and doesn't require a login, raising its appeal for music markets whose consumers might have lower per-capita incomes or haven't yet warmed up to the concept of a paid streaming subscription.</p>", "<p><strong>More songs than ever are in the 500-million-streams club, but power is still concentrated</strong></p>", "<p>Comparing the reports also outlines a dual narrative with respect to whether the music industry is really becoming a more-level playing field.</p>", "<p>On one hand, more artists and songs are participating in the \"top 1%\" of the industry. According to BuzzAngle, 31 songs were streamed over 500 million times in 2019, up from 21 such songs in 2018. A tier below, nearly 900 songs were streamed over 100 million times last year, up from 525 in 2018.</p>", "<p>But that doesn't mean the distribution of power has gotten any more equitable. BuzzAngle found that the 1,000 most-streamed songs in 2019 accounted for 18% of <em>all</em> streams, while the top 500 album titles were responsible for 30% of all album sales \u2014 same as the year before. </p>", "<p>Major labels also dominate nearly all of the top artist, album and song charts in both reports. With the exception of YNW Melly's \"<a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2019/02/20/ynw-melly-murder-on-my-mind-charis-e-kubrin-interview\">Murder On My Mind</a>,\" the top 25 songs, albums and artists of 2019 in BuzzAngle's report were all owned and/or distributed by a major label. Nielsen Music <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/business/8547770/nielsen-music-mrc-data-2019-report-streaming-tops-1-trillion-first-time\">found</a> that Universal Music Group, the largest record label by annual revenue, saw little change to its dominant market share, controlling 38.7% of the market in 2019 versus 38.1% in 2018 .</p>", "<p>This isn't necessarily to say that the music business is stale, or hostile to disruption. Consider \"Old Town Road.\" Within just one year, the song that Lil Nas X made with a $30 beat and then strategically seeded onto platforms like Triller and TikTok ended up becoming the most-streamed song <em>of the past 10 years</em>, beating ubiquitous hits like \"Despacito,\" \"Rockstar\" and \"Uptown Funk.\" But even \"Old Town Road\" arguably could not have gotten to its historic peak without major-label backing \u2014 in this case, a distribution deal with Columbia Records, which helped Lil Nas X land remixes with Billy Ray Cyrus, Young Thug, Mason Ramsey and RM from BTS. Not only did these high-profile celebrities help promote the single, the remixes' streams <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/18/743121439/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-billie-eilish-bad-guy-remix-billboard-charts\">also counted toward the original song's tallies</a>, helping the track make history as the longest-running No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>", "<p><strong>Vinyl might be having a \"revival,\" but CDs still account for the vast majority of physical albums</strong></p>", "<p>Album and song sales continue to wane across the board, seeing a 20% to 25% decline year-over-year in 2019, per BuzzAngle and Nielsen, respectively. Yet vinyl album sales continue to grow, by 11% to 15% annually (BuzzAngle and Nielsen, respectively). According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), revenues from vinyl records are poised to <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/vinyl-cds-revenue-growth-riaa-880959/\">surpass</a> those from CDs within the next few years.</p>", "<p>But there's one important caveat: In terms of units, vinyl is <em>not</em> the top physical music format \u2014 far from it, in fact. In 2019, CDs still accounted for 74% to 80% of physical album units sold, according to BuzzAngle and Nielsen, respectively. (Absolute numbers differ between the two reports; BuzzAngle pegs the number of CDs sold last year at 44.9 million, while Nielsen Music reports 54.8 million.)</p>", "<p>In contrast, vinyl constituted only around 17% to 19% of physical units sold last year \u2014 10.7 million per BuzzAngle and 18.8 million per Nielsen. While vinyl might be providing the music industry with a growing source of revenue, it doesn't come close to achieving the reach of the CD market. The vinyl market also skews the oldest out of all music formats; six out of the top-10-selling vinyl albums of 2019 were released before 2000, and 67% of vinyl sales overall last year came from catalog (i.e., music older than 18 months), according to Nielsen.</p>", "<p><strong>Remember: album sales aren't all created equal</strong></p>", "<p>Since streaming now accounts for the vast majority of music listening in the U.S. (again, about 80%), it's natural to assume that those plays are an appropriate proxy for consumer behavior across other formats. But a closer examination of the Nielsen Music and BuzzAngle reports reveals that that could not be further from the truth.</p>", "<p>Sales-oriented music charts, like the Billboard 200, calculate artists' rankings using formulas that convert stream counts into approximate \"album equivalents.\" For example, as of summer 2018, the Billboard charts register one \"album unit\" for every 1,250 paid audio streams, 3,750 ad-supported streams or 3,750 video streams. BuzzAngle, meanwhile, has a simpler, unweighted formula, adding one \"album project unit\" for every 1,500 on-demand streams, regardless of the streams' source or financial value.</p>", "<p>Under these formulas, if only one song on a ten-track album was streamed a million times, with the remaining tracks receiving zero activity, that would count just as much towards an album ranking as every track receiving 100,000 streams each. </p>", "<p>As of this month \u2014 this week, in fact \u2014 the Billboard 200 chart is also now <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/business/chart-beat/8546247/billboard-200-changes-youtube-video-data-streaming-album-charts\">incorporating YouTube data</a> into its formula, which puts even further weight on an album's biggest single(s) rather than on all the project's tracks as a whole. In short, album equivalent units often don't reflect actual album consumption, let alone physical album purchases \u2014 a nuance that's difficult to communicate in the context of a surface-level chart.</p>", "<p><strong>Radio listening and album sales paint a completely different picture of popularity than streaming</strong></p>", "<p>Let's compare the top artists on streaming versus terrestrial radio in both reports. </p>", "<p>Unsurprisingly, hip-hop/R&amp;B was the top genre for on-demand streaming in 2019, accounting for nearly a third of total on-demand streams. Moreover, rappers accounted for over half of the top ten most-streamed artists and songs of the year, according to Nielsen. BuzzAngle reported an even stronger skew in favor of hip-hop/R&amp;B, with the genre accounting for 80% of the top 25 artists of the year (by on-demand streams).</p>", "<p>In contrast, Nielsen's radio airplay charts are almost completely devoid of hip-hop. Towards the end of Nielsen's report, there are four lists of the top artists and songs by airplay spins and audience reach for the decade ending 2019, encompassing 40 total slots. Only <em>five</em> of those slots went to hip-hop/R&amp;B artists, with country and rock dominating nearly all others.</p>", "<p>Isolating album and song sales presents a similar story. Country and rock accounted for 14 of BuzzAngle's top 25 artists by album sales from 2015\u20132019, while only two rappers make an appearance in Nielsen's top 10 artists of the decade by album sales and song sales \u2014 Drake and Eminem.</p>", "<p><strong>Once disparate, the demographics of streaming, album sales and terrestrial radio listeners are now starting to blur</strong></p>", "<p>Listeners of all ages, including parents and seniors, are adopting smart speakers and other voice-enabled devices at a rapid pace, helping revivify back catalog in the streaming era. And it's not just the old guard who can benefit from selling vinyl: Colorful physical products like vinyl records can potentially help an artist stand out in the crowded streaming landscape \u2014 and, when bundled with a digital download, can even help them climb the charts (as long as they <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/want-an-album-with-that-t-shirt-billboard-tightens-rules-on-bundling-music-and-merchandise-11574776800\">stick to the rules</a>). In general, the physical market is also increasingly online, with nearly half of all physical album sales in 2019 happening via online e-commerce stores, according to BuzzAngle.</p>", "<p>Perhaps the most surprising case study: While Billie Eilish may be a streaming darling, she also has a much more solid track record in vinyl sales than most of her modern-pop peers. In 2019, 19% (BuzzAngle) to 26% (Nielsen Music) of physical units sold for Eilish's <em>When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go</em> were vinyl LPs. In contrast, only 6% of physical sales for Taylor Swift and 9% of those for Harry Styles came from vinyl.</p>", "<p><strong>The upper echelon of music is still a boy's club</strong></p>", "<p>A disappointing takeaway from both BuzzAngle's and Nielsen's reports is the lack of women among the top-selling artists and songs of both 2019 and the past decade \u2014 suggesting that progress towards gender equality in recorded music over the past five to ten years has been incremental at best.</p>", "<p>Gender inequities vary somewhat by musical genre. The upper echelons of the pop charts tend to be more inclusive \u2014 with the likes of Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift reigning in 2019 \u2014 but the top of the hip-hop, country and rock charts remain male-dominated. BuzzAngle's report reveals that all of the top-consumed hip-hop songs and albums of 2019 were performed by men. With the exception of Lizzo, Nielsen's hip-hop/R&amp;B year-end charts were also completely male, and not a single woman made it onto Nielsen's top country and rock charts for the year.</p>", "<p>While disruptive in a commercial sense, the advent of streaming has not necessarily made this gender split any better. According to BuzzAngle, with the exception of Cardi B's \"Bodak Yellow\" and Camila Cabello's \"Havana,\" <em>all</em> of the 25 top-streamed songs over the past five years were by male artists.</p>", "<p>These findings parallel more longitudinal studies carried out by institutions such as the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which <a href=\"http://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/no-country-for-female-artists-research-brief_2019-04-04.pdf\">found</a> that female artists accounted only for 16% of the top 500 charted country songs from 2014 to 2018. Artists like <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/jennifer-nettles-equal-play?curator=MusicREDEF\">Jennifer Nettles Glamour</a> have been speaking out against these inequities for years, yet they still play out across streaming, physical and radio formats, as well as in the live sector (e.g. the <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/01/9131472/2020-coachella-lineup-no-women-headlining\">absence of women headliners</a> from this year's Coachella lineup).</p>", "<p>It may be a new decade, but the music business is still rife with ingrained biases and gatekeeping practices that prevent women and other minority groups from accessing key exposure, revenue and career opportunities \u2014 let alone appearing on year-end industry reports.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

The company says Russian hackers sent seemingly legitimate emails pointing to malicious websites that looked like authentic Burisma sites to try to dupe employees into sharing private login information.</p>", "<p>The phishing ploy worked, says Falkowitz, who formerly worked at the National Security Agency. \"What we know is that they're able to access the usernames and passwords for the employees of Burisma. And from there, they're able to see likely what's in those accounts,\" he says.</p>", "<p>The vast majority of cyberattacks begin with a phishing campaign, according to Area 1. In addition to the Russian attack on the DNC's systems, one of the most damaging recent cyberattacks began with a spear-phishing email sent to Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta. That email instructed Podesta to click a special link to pick out a new password for his Google email account \u2014 a process the hackers then monitored, giving them full access to his account.</p>", "<p>\"Once you have the usernames and passwords for an employee's email account, there's quite a lot that can be done,\" Falkowitz says. \"You can observe all of the data that's contained within [their] email. You can also launch further phishing campaigns \u2014 and you can use that data to do quite a lot to move throughout the company's networks.\"</p>", "<p>In recent years, the GRU's hackers have been very busy and extremely disruptive, attacking a variety of high-profile targets with the goal of revealing embarrassing information.</p>", "<p>\"The GRU has been linked to cyberattacks at the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and the compromise of the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493776953/russian-hackers-breached-athletes-data-world-anti-doping-agency-says\">World Anti-Doping Agency</a>,\" Area 1 says. \"The GRU has also been linked to the targeting of European foreign ministries and defense agencies, campaigns for the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, FIFA and Westinghouse.\"</p>", "<p>Area 1 says it also linked the GRU phishing campaign against Burisma to another phishing attack targeting a company founded by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose phone conversation with Trump last summer sparked calls to impeach the U.S. president.</p>", "<p>Trump has previously asked Russia to help his political campaign \u2014 most famously just months before the 2016 vote.</p>", "<p>\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing\" from Clinton's email servers, then-candidate Trump said at a news conference in Miami on July 27, 2016.</p>", "<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/13/628773789/deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-unveils-new-hacking-charges-in-dnc-case\">indictments</a> secured by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, Russian military officers began attacking the Clinton campaign and other Democratic targets that same day.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

If they don't own a car, they have to find a ride, take public transit, walk or bike to the closest store. The trip takes time, money and energy \u2014 and can be especially taxing for people who are older or who have physical disabilities. </p>", "<p>But a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2756107\">new analysis</a> from researchers at Yale University suggests that one service already in place in many of these areas could help make it easier to access fresh, healthy food: online grocery delivery. And it lends support to expanding a <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/04/18/usda-launches-snap-online-purchasing-pilot\">pilot program</a> that lets people use their benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 aka food stamps \u2014 to pay for those groceries.</p>", "<p>\"For individuals using SNAP, there's been a lot of bad rap about the quality of food that they purchase, and there's not been a lot of focus on trying to support individuals getting better-quality diets that has been successful,\" says lead researcher <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/eric_brandt/\">Eric J. Brandt</a>, national clinician scholar at Yale University's School of Medicine. \"So I really hope that this is part of that pathway towards better quality and better health.\" </p>", "<p>The study, which was published by JAMA Network Open this month, looked at eight states in which SNAP recipients can <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/736181304/using-food-stamps-for-online-grocery-shopping-is-getting-easier\">use</a> their benefits to buy groceries online as part of the USDA pilot program: Alabama, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington. </p>", "<p>Within these states, the study found that nearly 93% of SNAP-eligible households in urban food deserts were located in areas that fully qualified for grocery delivery. </p>", "<p>Brandt hopes the study is one step in finding more applicable solutions for people living in areas with high rates of food insecurity. </p>", "<p>\"What is already in place as a potential mechanism to improve their access to quality foods? Delivery, definitely,\" he says. </p>", "<p>For the study, Brandt looked at the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/03/13/174112591/how-to-find-a-food-desert-near-you\">USDA's Food Access Research Atlas</a> to find census tracts for areas classified as food deserts. Then he compared these results with all the stores that accept SNAP and also deliver to those locations. </p>", "<p>But while urban food deserts were overwhelmingly covered by delivery services offered through companies such as Instacart, Peapod and ShopRite, the results in rural areas were not nearly as promising. </p>", "<p>Of the 59 rural census tracts analyzed, zero qualified for full grocery delivery. Thirty percent of them were partially deliverable to, and 69.5% of the tracts were not deliverable to at all. </p>", "<p>The difference between partial and full delivery, Brandt explains, is a discrepancy in the two sets of data \u2014 while food deserts are measured by census tracts, delivery is determined by ZIP code. </p>", "<p>\"They're mutually exclusive, and they don't define each other,\" he says. \"So that's why there's this middle category of partially deliverable, because some of the ZIP codes that were in the census tract for the food desert had delivery, but other ZIP codes in that same census tract did not.\" </p>", "<p>There is also the challenge of paying for the delivery itself. As of now, SNAP benefits in participating states can be used to purchase food online but not to pay for delivery fees. </p>", "<p>Julie Companey, the director of grocery marketing at <a href=\"https://valassis.com/\">Valassis</a>, a firm that conducts market-specific research, says that ordering groceries through a service like Instacart could lead to a potential upmark in prices compared with the costs in stores. But for some SNAP recipients, the convenience of ordering online may still outweigh these hurdles. </p>", "<p>Companey points to a 2017 <a href=\"https://blog.fieldagent.net/food-stamps-users-surveyed-about-bopis-grocery-delivery\">survey</a> of SNAP recipients crowdsourced by Field Agent, a retail-auditing firm, in which 51% of respondents said they were \"completely likely\" to buy groceries online for pickup or delivery if given the option, even with additional delivery fees. The top three reasons respondents gave for choosing to order online were convenience, being able to pay for their groceries without other shoppers seeing they were using SNAP benefits and, for parents, not having to navigate the grocery store with their kids in tow. </p>", "<p>Brandt says there's hope that these additional cost challenges, like delivery fees, can be addressed through the pilot program in the future. For now, he says the study is proof that maybe allowing more SNAP recipients to turn to online  grocery delivery could mean an overall increase in the quality of food they're putting on the table. </p>", "<p> The pilot program will run for two years, until April 2021, at which point it will undergo review to ensure that all online transactions are secure and run without technical difficulties. The USDA <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/pressrelease/2017/fns-000117\">hopes</a> to eventually expand the program nationwide. </p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Keita said, in a very heartfelt way, that he had been destroyed by the idea that we were going to keep fighting and killing each other.\"</p>", "<p>Takahashi's games are funny and absurd at the surface, but kind and earnest at their cores. Although he originally studied to be a sculptor, he became upset when his classmates were throwing out their work after receiving grades on their projects. \"I was very shocked about that,\" Takahashi said. \"We have an environmental crisis. I don't want to make more garbage.\"</p>", "<p>Takahashi aimed to make work that was useful, but also made people laugh. While still in school, he sculpted a functional planter in the form of a goat. The water runs through the goat's back and drains out of its udders.</p>", "<p>When Takahashi presented the sculpture to his peers, they laughed. He saw a transformative power in that laughter, and it's an impulse that has powered his work since. </p>", "<p><em>Wattam </em>demonstrates that trademark humor, said Harry DeLorme, who exhibited a survey of Takahashi's work this year at the Telfair Museums in Savannah, Ga. DeLorme pointed out that one <em>Wattam</em> character is a mouth that eats other characters and excretes them as poop. \"It's full of very strange things,\" he said. </p>", "<p>Also at the exhibit were early Takahashi sculptures, as well as designs for a since-cancelled (and seemingly very dangerous) playground. </p>", "<p class=\"slideshow__counter\">\n            <span class=\"slideshow__current-count\">1</span> of <span class=\"slideshow__total-count\">3</span>\n        </p>", "<p>DeLorme said that Takahashi's games work so well in a fine-art context because they have a singular \"tactile quality.\" <em>Tenya Wanya Teens, </em>for example, has 32 buttons and two joysticks. It's about two teenage boys, and was designed to mimic the awkwardness of adolescence.</p>", "<p>The controls are color-coded to different activities. But the colors switch around as the game progresses, making seemingly simple tasks more challenging. \"You think the character is going to tell a girl he loves her, and then he starts urinating,\" DeLorme said. </p>", "<p>In comparison to some of Takahashi's prior work, <em>Wattam </em>feels less cynical \u2014 more earnest, kinder. It opens as a green cube wearing a top hat \u2014 it's named the Mayor \u2014 sits on a rock. The Mayor is crying. But pretty soon, the Mayor gets up and begins to explore. \"You get the sense that something bad has happened, and that all of the beings that inhabit the world have been lost,\" DeLorme said.</p>", "<p>Other beings start to show up \u2014 all in the form of everyday objects, like toilets or sushi rolls. They interact with each other in joyous and simple ways: they climb atop one another, hold hands, run in circles, explode, laugh together. </p>", "<p>Takahashi said he came up with the idea for <em>Wattam </em>when he moved to Vancouver and was living in a place with a diverse population. \"We still have some issues, or problems, or conflict in this world,\" he said. \"War, fighting ... because of a different perspective, different religion, different skin color. I believe that differences make a good deep culture.\" </p>", "<p>He also wanted players to feel a kind of reverence for the everyday objects that we sometimes don't pay attention to. He said that in our fast-fashion economy, it's easy to treat necessary things as if they are expendable. \"I wanted to make people realize there are no unnecessary things,\" he said. \"A cup. A chopstick. Those are very important.\" </p>", "<p>Takahashi has always had some difficulty treating his own work with this kind of reverence. Earlier this year, as part of his exhibit at the Telfair Museums, he gave a presentation to a group of children and students. On one slide, an arrow pointed upward, denoting more useful professions: sanitation workers, doctors, farmers. Beside the arrow pointing downward? Game designers and sculptors. </p>", "<p>Takahashi's humility and self-deprecation is well-documented. In 2005, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4392964.stm\">he told the BBC</a> that in 10 years he would not be making video games any more. In another interview with <em>Gamasutra </em>in 2009, <a href=\"https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/116862/Interview_The_Melancholy_Of_Keita_Takahashi.php\">he earnestly asked the interviewer</a> if he had any suggestions on how to be a better commercial game designer.</p>", "<p>I asked Takahashi if, despite many comments seemingly to the contrary, he liked making video games. He said yes, but then elaborated that designing video games is a luxury. \"We have the doctor, and the farmer,\" he said. \"Based on their fantastic job, I fortunately can make a video game.\" </p>", "<p>But Takahashi keeps making video games. \"I want to be a billionaire,\" he said, laughing. \"So I can make my own playground.\"</p>", "<p>At whatever cost, Takahashi is set on finding more ways to make us play. </p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

The unplanned maneuver used too much fuel, preventing the Starliner from rendezvousing with the station. </p>", "<p>NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said that had astronauts been on board Friday's Starliner flight, they would have been safe and could have taken control of the vehicle. </p>", "<p>\"In fact, had they been in there, we very well may be orbiting, or docking with the space station tomorrow had they been in the spacecraft,\" he said.</p>", "<p>\"We trained extensively for this type of contingency and had we been on board there, there could have been actions that we could have taken,\" said NASA astronaut Nicole Mann. She's slated to fly on the first crewed Starliner mission next year.</p>", "<p>\"That's why you have test pilots on board, especially for these early missions,\" she said. \"We are looking forward to flying on Starliner. We don't have any safety concerns.</p>", "<p>The test is part of <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-crew-program-the-essentials\">NASA's $6.8 billion Commercial Crew program</a> to launch humans from the U.S. and end a nearly decadelong reliance on the Russian space agency for rides to the station. Currently, NASA astronauts hitch a ride on Soyuz capsules.</p>", "<p>Boeing is going head-to-head with SpaceX, which conducted a successful docking of its Dragon capsule with the station in March. SpaceX could send astronauts on Dragon as soon as the spring. </p>", "<p>Friday's launch of Starliner also comes as Boeing's public image has been battered by the fatal crash of two of its 737 Max jetliners last year and the subsequent global grounding of the aircraft type.</p>", "<p>Whether Boeing or SpaceX, when NASA does launch humans from U.S. soil sometime next year, it will be the first time since the last Space Shuttle mission in 2011. </p>", "<p>\"We're doing it in a way that's never been done before,\" Bridenstine said. \"This time when we go, we're going to go with commercial partners. NASA is not purchasing, owning and operating the hardware. We're buying the service.\" </p>", "<p>It's a lot like calling an Uber to space. NASA is paying for rides to the station, relying on two commercial vehicles \u2014 SpaceX's <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/dragon\">Crew Dragon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.boeing.com/space/starliner/launch/index.html\">Boeing's Starliner.</a> </p>", "<p>Originally NASA called for U.S. launches to the station to resume by the end of 2017. The program and its delays date back to its start nearly a decade ago. Funding for the project was awarded in steps, and each round brought new developments and eventually whittled down the companies getting the Commercial Crew contracts to just two.</p>", "<p>However, comprehensive congressional funding was lacking. \"They were underfunded at the beginning,\" said retired NASA astronaut Sandy Magnus. \"Continually fighting this battle of one-year funding plus getting into these continuing resolutions [in Congress] really stops the momentum of any technical program.\"</p>", "<p>The program has also faced technical issues. Both Boeing and SpaceX rely on parachutes to safely land back on Earth, and testing their design has delayed certifying the capsules for human passengers.</p>", "<p>\"You wouldn't think that parachutes would be hard. It's a technology that's, that's actually decades old,\" said space <a href=\"https://www.astralytical.com/\">policy analyst</a> Laura Forczyk. NASA has been using parachutes for all of its human space vehicles. \"It turns out that it's really hard to make them efficient and reliable.</p>", "<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This week SpaceX completed the 7th successful system test of Crew Dragon\u2019s upgraded Mark 3 parachutes, which will provide a safe landing back on Earth for astronauts returning from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@space_station</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FdBXdvqmf4\">pic.twitter.com/FdBXdvqmf4</a></p>", "<p>Boeing and SpaceX both experienced additional issues with their abort systems. SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Boeing's Starliner use engines built into the capsule that fire and push the vehicle \u2014 and the astronauts \u2014 to safety should something go wrong midflight. </p>", "<p>\"When you think about these companies designing and building these vehicles, and this is sort of new to them, you would expect to have some technical challenges along the way,\" said Magnus, who is also a member of NASA's <a href=\"https://oiir.hq.nasa.gov/asap/\">Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) </a>which advises the space agency on safety issues. \"From an ASAP viewpoint, that's not really the concerning part. The thing that we watch is just how they're dealt with.\"</p>", "<p>Both companies have responded to the technical challenges. SpaceX has been continuously testing its parachutes. It also says it found the root cause of an <a href=\"https://www.wmfe.org/spacex-crew-capsule-destroyed-during-testing-cargo-version-go-for-launch/106995\">explosion earlier this year related to its abort engines</a>. It will test that system next month by firing the abort motors midflight after launching a test capsule on its Falcon 9 rocket.</p>", "<p>Boeing completed a <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2019/11/04/pad-abort-test-complete/\">test of its abort system</a> last month and called the mission a success. But one of the capsule's parachutes failed to open before touchdown. Boeing said despite the failed chute, if a crew was on board they would land safely. At a news conference this week, Boeing said it identified the cause of the failure and has fixed the issue. </p>", "<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Touchdown! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BoeingSpace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BoeingSpace</a> completed its Pad Abort Test designed to verify that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starliner?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Starliner</a> spacecraft's systems will protect <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Commercial_Crew?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Commercial_Crew</a> astronauts in the unlikely event of an emergency prior to liftoff.

NASA is nearly out of rides to the station on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft, and the last seat is booked for April 2020. Anticipating further delays, the agency said it is conducting \"fact finding\" discussions to purchase two additional seats from Roscosmos, Russia's state-run space launch provider. </p>", "<p>\"When you have a new program coming on board like the Commercial Crew Program, it makes sense to make sure we are looking at everything, working out the steps and not putting anybody in a position where they feel rushed,\" said NASA's deputy ISS manager Joel Montalbano. </p>", "<p>Despite the delays, both Commercial Crew companies are nearing the finish line and targeting the first launch of humans on Commercial Crew vehicles early next year.</p>", "<p>The same congressional funding that delayed Commercial Crew could affect another NASA priority \u2014 returning humans to the moon by 2024. An appropriations bill working its way through Congress doesn't fully fund the program, which could delay that mission into the late 2020s.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>A previous version of this story misspelled Joel Montalbano's last name as Montoblano.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

With no similar federal law on the horizon, this one is expected to set the standard nationally for some time to come.</p>", "<p>So what does it mandate?</p>", "<p>\"On Jan. 1, 2020, all Californians will be able to find out what personal information a business is collecting about them, their devices and their children,\" said Mary Stone Ross, one of the new law's co-authors, and a nationally recognized data privacy expert. </p>", "<p>According to the law, consumers will be able to opt out of the sale of their personal information. If a company fails to implement reasonable security practices and consumers' personal information is breached, they'll be allowed to sue those companies.</p>", "<p>Companies can still collect the data: what you buy; where you go, and when; all the photos you've ever taken; your emails, even the ones you deleted. </p>", "<p>But what companies must now do is tell you what they're collecting when you ask, and delete it all if you ask for that. However, some companies can deny your request to delete if the data is required in order to complete a financial transaction or protect against fraud.</p>", "<p>What companies can't do anymore, legally, is sell that data if you tell them not to. But if they do anyway, consumers can't sue. The law reserves lawsuits for another all-too-common problem: \"It's only for data breaches. So if certain categories of personal information, for example, your Social Security number, are breached, and a business fails to implement reasonable security practices, then you have cause,\" said Stone Ross.</p>", "<p><strong>California's attorney general</strong></p>", "<p>The office of Attorney General Xavier Becerra won't begin to enforce the law until July 1, 2020, but Becerra said he considers the law in effect as of Jan. 1, 2020, \"right after that first kiss, and the hugs, and the champagne.\"</p>", "<p>However, the attorney general's budget is limited. He has said his office is likely to conduct only three enforcement actions a year. Against who? He won't say yet, although Becerra said \"the bigger the company, the bigger the problem. The bigger the universe that has data that is used in certain ways, that could lead to that violation, the bigger the case will be.\"</p>", "<p>There are particularly sensitive kinds of information protection his office is keen to prioritize. </p>", "<p>\"I think my health information is sensitive. I think my Social Security number is sensitive. I think my dating patterns, especially since I'm married, would be sensitive,\" Becerra said jokingly.</p>", "<p>Then he added that \"aggressive, early, decisive enforcement\" is likely to focus on the sale of data involving children. \"The last thing you want is for any company to think that we're going to be soft on letting you misuse kids' personal information.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Tech giants </strong></p>", "<p>Industry groups spent the last year trying to rewrite and soften the law. It's expected they'll sue to stop its rollout in the new year, even as most have taken some steps to comply with the CCPA. Many businesses complain that there's a lack of clarity on the regulations the attorney general is still in the process of crafting.</p>", "<p>Common Sense Media, the privacy advocacy group, has a template \"Do not sell my data\" request form on its website. But businesses want the attorney general's office to produce sample forms and notices. The attorney general's office has released a Standardized Regulatory Impact Assessment that demonstrates the potential scope of the new law.</p>", "<p>In the meantime, some companies such as Microsoft are adopting the new rules right away, nationwide. </p>", "<p>But while Facebook has made it easy to download your data (as have Twitter and Google), the Menlo Park-based social media giant argues that it sells advertisers access to users, so it's up to the advertisers to let users opt out or not. </p>", "<p>That doesn't pass the smell test for a number of industry watchers, including Chris Hoofnagle, who teaches technology regulation at the University of California, Berkeley. </p>", "<p>\"Facebook, in particular, appears to be interpreting the law in a very opportunistic way. So that they don't actually need to do anything to comply with it,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Hoofnagle thinks the biggest tech companies in Silicon Valley are in a financial position to bet it'll be a while before the attorney general's office comes for them.</p>", "<p>Tech companies could earn serious money in the meantime. Facebook alone made $55 billion in 2018 providing advertisers access to users. </p>", "<p>\"Enforcement is the big unknown here. But Facebook will be in trouble if the attorney general picks up the law and uses it,\" Hoofnagle said.</p>", "<p><strong>Data brokers</strong></p>", "<p>Less talked about but similarly dramatic will be the law's impact on data brokers, companies built on collecting and selling information whether or not consumers are aware of it.</p>", "<p>The law applies to any company that meets any one of three thresholds annually: It has at least $25 million in revenue, makes at least half its money by selling data or gathers information on at least 50,000 consumers. Companies that don't fix violations within 30 days of being notified can be fined up to $7,500 for each intentional violation.</p>", "<p>Data tracking and selling has become big business for a wide variety of companies, including automakers, retailers, software companies and others you don't necessarily realize are running a side business serving advertisers.</p>", "<p>Many consumers have technically agreed to the tracking and sale of their data by clicking \"yes\" to those difficult-to-understand acceptance forms required to use a host of websites and apps.</p>", "<p>Consider the last party invitation you received through Evite. </p>", "<p>\"They're collecting inferences that they glean from the invitation,\" Mary Stone Ross explained. \"So they're collecting and selling presence of children in household; your religion; if you're moving, or expecting a baby. This is something the CCPA will expose, because now you can read their privacy policy.\"</p>", "<p>Data privacy activists such as Stone Ross are hoping that even if individuals aren't that keen to dig into the fine print, lawyers and journalists will do so in a way that garners public attention.</p>", "<p>Other data privacy laws like this are expected to crop up in other states because there is no federal law, despite the introduction of multiple bills in Washington, D.C., such as the Online Privacy Act put forward by Reps.

In the multibillion-dollar effort to wipe polio off the face of the planet, the persistence of the virus in Pakistan remains a primary obstacle to success. That was true in 2014 and is still true today. In fact, this year, the number of cases in that country has spiked dramatically.

Our teams of reporters and photographers filed more than 200 stories and won a Peabody award for their efforts. Ben de la Cruz, the lead visuals editor for our Ebola coverage, selected this story because its photos and text (by NPR's John Poole with additional images by freelancer Tommy Trenchard) and audio (by NPR's<strong> </strong>Sami Yenigun) offer an intimate look at a town ravaged by the virus. The story of Barkedu serves as a reminder that epidemics don't end after the last case: A catastrophic outbreak can cause trauma and disruption that affects the lives of survivors and their families for years to come.</p>", "<p><strong>Nurith Aizenman: </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/16/414724767/people-are-finally-talking-about-the-thing-nobody-wants-to-talk-about\"><strong>People Are Finally Talking About The Thing Nobody Wants To Talk About</strong></a><strong> (June 16, 2015)</strong></p>", "<p>The premise of this story \u2014 that talking about menstruation is a big taboo \u2014 seems almost quaint today. But at the time \u2013 almost the exact midpoint of this past decade \u2013 it was still rare for the media to cover the difficulties that girls and women in low-income countries face around managing their periods, let alone how these difficulties might hampering their ability to get an education or well-paying work. Back then even many global health advocates were, at best, oblivious to the issue and, at worst, squeamish about exploring it.</p>", "<p>The reader response to this piece offered a hint of the change that was brewing.

And over the ensuing months the topic of menstruation<strong> </strong>burst into the public discourse in such a big and varied way that by year's end NPR's health team<strong> </strong>declared 2015 \"The Year of the Period.\"</p>", "<p>Since then activism on this topic has only accelerated \u2014 including campaigns to lift taxes on menstrual products across the United States, end bans in India that prevent menstruating women from entering temples and stop the practice in Nepal of requiring girls to wait out their periods in \"menstrual sheds.\" Early this year a movie about tampons even won the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/02/28/694733979/a-period-movie-won-the-oscar-so-why-are-some-menstrual-health-experts-ambivalent\">Oscar for best documentary short.</a></p>", "<p><strong>Rhitu Chatterjee: </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/03/17/470843894/india-s-metro-subway-system-in-delhi\"><strong>So Maybe Washington, D.C., Should Ask Delhi How To Run A Metro System</strong></a><strong> (March 17, 2016)</strong></p>", "<p>Back in 2016, the Washington D.C. metro was shut down for about a day for critical maintenance work. My editor emailed me \u2013 I was living in New Delhi at the time \u2014 to ask if there was a story to write about metro rail systems in India. I jumped on the assignment because I'd been looking for an excuse to write about the Delhi metro.</p>", "<p>The New Delhi metro system is a great example of how stories about developing countries don't have to be about things that are terrible, like disease, corruption, violence, pollution. Developing countries often innovate to solve their own problems, and sometimes, their creativity and innovation far outpaces what's happening in the West.</p>", "<p><strong>Tim McDonnell: </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/04/02/522206721/short-film-how-water-gets-from-the-nile-to-thirsty-refugees\"><strong>How Water Gets From The Nile To Thirsty Refugees</strong></a><strong> (April 2, 2017)</strong></p>", "<p>In early 2017, northern Uganda was the setting of one of the world's fastest-growing refugee crises, as hundreds of thousands of people fled civil war in neighboring South Sudan. When they reached safety in Uganda, there was a new challenge: the lack of access to water. As aid workers struggled to drill wells and truck water in from the Nile River, refugees like Leya Jogo, a schoolteacher supporting several children, waited in line all day, every day, for a few gallons for cooking, drinking and bathing.</p>", "<p>This profile touched on two key challenges of the decade: The unprecedented number of displaced people globally, and the growing specter of water shortages.</p>", "<p>Leya's story touched me deeply on a personal level. I became much more conscious of my own water consumption. The day I finished reporting this story, I went back to my hotel, which didn't have running water, and was handed a bucket of water. I used half of it just for a shower. Leya would have spent all day searching for that much water.

And then the 47-year-old mother of 10 \u2014 four biological and six orphaned children ranging from age 5 to 15 \u2014 had to feign insanity to keep the insurgents away. Her story speaks to the great pain inflicted by terrorists \u2014 but it's not just a tale of suffering. It's a reminder that even in the face of terrible events, which were all too frequent in the 2010s, the human spirit is truly, deeply resilient.</p>", "<p><strong>Malaka Gharib: </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/11/26/565694874/volunteering-abroad-read-this-before-you-post-that-selfie\"><strong>Volunteering Abroad? Read This Before You Post That Selfie</strong></a><strong> (November 26, 2017)</strong></p>", "<p>One of my favorite (and most popular) stories explored<strong> </strong>a guide on how to take ethical selfies while volunteering in low-income countries. Created by a group of international development students and academics in Norway, the guide urges people to think before they post photos of themselves with those they are trying to help \u2013 especially children \u2013 warning that these images perpetuate the idea that only Western aid, charity and intervention can save the world. The how-to clearly resonated with NPR readers, pulling in more than 1.3 million views. But what I liked about the story most is that it reflects changing attitudes about how volunteers should act in these parts of the world \u2013 and a willingness to show respect to the places they visit.</p>", "<p><strong>Kamala Thiagarajan: </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/12/16/570827107/in-interviews-with-122-rapists-student-pursues-not-so-simple-question-why\"><strong>In Interviews With 122 Rapists, Student Pursues Not So Simple Question: Why?</strong></a><strong> (December 16, 2017)</strong></p>", "<p>As a woman, living in India, I've given great thought to my country's struggle to deal with the rising number of rape cases. Since 2012, India has been engaged in meaningful conversations about how to keep women safe. Our laws have been strengthened and so have our punishments, and yet, we're still reeling under reports of violent rapes. This story, in which a young woman tries to assess the mindset of the rapist, without judgement and condemnation, holds some key answers as to why rape occurs. What are the ingredients that brew the personality of the rapist? Criminal reform should be an important conversation in the decades ahead. It matters when it comes to keeping our communities and our women safer.</p>", "<p><strong>Michaeleen Doucleff: </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/01/24/575220206/is-there-a-ticking-time-bomb-under-the-arctic\"><strong>Is There A Ticking Time Bomb Under The Arctic?</strong></a><strong> (January 24, 2018)</strong></p>", "<p>To do this story, I walked through a door to a red shed a short drive north of Fairbanks, Alaska, and came face-to-face with a ticking time bomb. The door leads to a tunnel that goes 1,000 feet deep so scientists can study the potential risks posed by permafrost that thaws out. As the temperature at some permafrost sites rises because of climate change, ancient bacteria, frozen for 25,000 years, could come back alive again \"given the right environmental conditions,\" said my guide, Dr. Thomas Douglas, a geochemist at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. I hope that this story had an impact on the way people think about the Arctic and climate change. And it doesn't look as if the temperature will dip in the near future.

In fact, people may not quite understand who they are. They're not certified medical professionals. They may have only a high school education, if that. And they are vital to keeping a community informed and healthy, whether during a crisis like Ebola or the day-to-day tasks of making sure kids get vaccinated and people are treated for diseases.

But because a very small number of women taking the drug had babies with severe birth defects, it's not being given to women of childbearing age in poor countries where there may not be access to reliable birth control. Because dolutegravir is so undeniably good at not only treating HIV patients but controlling the spread of disease, countries in the years ahead will have no choice but to beef up their health systems so that young women can obtain reliable birth control that will enable them to take dolutegravir. The two go hand-in-hand: a gold standard AIDS drug and reliable birth control.</p>", "<p><strong><em>Share with us: What was your favorite Goats and Soda story this decade?

He documented 17 significant inaccuracies and omissions in the bureau's applications to wiretap Page.</p>", "<p>\"We found that investigators failed to meet their basic obligations of ensuring that the FISA applications were scrupulously accurate,\" Horowitz told lawmakers.</p>", "<p>Information that supported the FBI's case to eavesdrop on Page was given to the court, while information that undercut it was left out.</p>", "<p>Those findings have fueled calls for reforms to how the FISA process works.</p>", "<p>One of the most noteworthy advocates for change is Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>", "<p>\"I'd hate to lose the ability of the FISA court to operate at a time when we need it most,\" Graham told Horowitz at a hearing days after the inspector general's review came out. \"But after your report, I have serious concerns about whether the FISA court can continue unless there's fundamental reform.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Longtime critics: Where you been?</strong></p>", "<p>For longtime critics of the FISA process, the problems unearthed by the inspector general point to what they've said all along were deeper issues with national security surveillance.</p>", "<p>Elizabeth Goitein, the co-director of the Liberty and National Security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, noted that Horowitz did not find evidence that the Page surveillance was the result of political bias. </p>", "<p>\"That means that his kind of shading of the facts is most likely par for the course in FISA applications,\" Goitein said. </p>", "<p>\"What we have to worry about is that the system is so secretive and so one-sided \u2014 where the FISA court hears only from the government \u2014 that these kinds of distortions can go undetected.\"</p>", "<p>It took a nearly 20-month investigation by the inspector general to bring them to light in this instance.

Three parts of FISA are set to expire in March.</p>", "<p>The Brennan Center's Goitein says that gives members of Congress who have long opposed FISA reform<strong> </strong>a chance to address the problems raised by the inspector general's report.</p>", "<p>\"So we'll see if they've had a change of heart, whether they're actually going to build in greater civil liberties protections or whether all of this talk about FISA reform was just political posturing.\"</p>", "<p>One longstanding question has been whether there should be an advocate for defendants at the time authorities are requesting a warrant.</p>", "<p>Today, FISA judges hear from government attorneys making the case for why investigators suspect someone and why they believe they're justified in conducting surveillance.

A hotel employee was eventually fined 500 yuan, or about $80, for passing on the leak. But beyond that, the trail went cold.

In the western region of Xinjiang, residents are forced to install surveillance software on their cellphones that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac0ffb2e-8b36-11e8-b18d-0181731a0340\">scans their pictures and texts</a>.

There's a high burden of proof on the victim in order to seek compensation for damages. That has led to the proliferation of an illicit marketplace of personal information.

He was once Amazon China's chief security officer but left to start Entropage, a company that provides encryption tools users can add to email and messaging apps.</p>", "<p>The Chinese government has contradictory stances on digital privacy. On one hand, it wants porous technology so it can monitor communications between activists, for example, and control access to information. In the last two years, it has arrested or shut down scores of virtual private network providers, the software commonly used to jump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=220106496\">China's great firewall</a>.</p>", "<p>In January 2019, the state cyberspace regulator announced a stronger stance on data collection.

The claims range from unwanted touching and kissing to rape.</p>", "<p>How safe is your Uber ride? That question has dogged the company for years, as it has faced complaints from passengers and drivers alleging they have been sexually assaulted in an Uber.</p>", "<p>Now Uber is revealing the scale of those complaints for the first time.</p>", "<p>The company received 5,981 allegations of serious sexual assault in the U.S. over two years, according to a <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/us/en/about/reports/us-safety-report/\">new report covering 2017 and 2018</a>. The claims range from unwanted touching and kissing to rape.</p>", "<p>The U.S.-only report also covers deaths involving Uber rides. During those two years, 107 people died in crashes involving Uber cars, and 19 people were killed in physical assaults during or soon after an Uber ride.</p>", "<p>As troubling as those statistics are, the incidents they capture are rare. People in the U.S. took 2.3 billion rides using Uber in those two years. For 99.9% of those trips, no safety incident was reported, while 0.1% had some sort of complaint. But the serious safety problems detailed in the report were even more uncommon.</p>", "<p>\"At the scale that Uber operates, we're going to see both the good and the bad that happens in society because we're operating so many trips every single day,\" said Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer.</p>", "<p>\"One of the unfortunate but sad truths is that sexual assault, sexual violence is far more prevalent in American society than a lot of people recognize,\" he said. \"That exists in companies, it exists in classrooms, it exists on university campuses and homes. Uber's not immune to that.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Data paint a mixed, and limited, picture</strong></p>", "<p>The report is a window into a long-standing <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/25/782732967/uber-stripped-of-its-license-to-operate-in-london\">problem </a>for ride-hailing companies \u2014 not just Uber, but competitors around the world, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/11/759899409/lyft-facing-flood-of-lawsuits-after-riders-report-they-were-sexually-attacked-by\">Lyft</a> in the U.S., Didi in China and Ola in India. The apps have come under intense scrutiny for how they screen drivers, handle complaints and remove offenders from their platforms.</p>", "<p>However, Uber's report doesn't present a complete picture. When it comes to sexual assaults, Uber includes what it defines as the five most severe categories: nonconsensual kissing of a nonsexual body part, attempted nonconsensual sexual penetration, nonconsensual touching of a sexual body part, nonconsensual kissing of a sexual body part and nonconsensual sexual penetration.</p>", "<p>The report does not include other types of sexual misconduct, like masturbation, asking for sex or verbal threats of assault. Uber worked with the National Sexual Violence Resource Center and other advocacy groups to develop the report and address safety issues.</p>", "<p>The report counts car crashes and physical assaults that resulted in a death, but not those that resulted in injuries \u2014 likely far larger numbers. The company says it will release updated figures every two years.</p>", "<p>The rate of serious sexual assault incidents per ride went down in every category between 2017 and 2018. For example, the average rate of sexual assault reports across the five categories fell 16% from one year to the next.</p>", "<p>\"I feel comfortable that Uber is a very safe mode of transportation. And I think the data in this report actually indicates that as well,\" West said.</p>", "<p>But Uber also warned that rates could go up in the years to come if more people are encouraged to report sexual assault. Reporting rates for sexual violence and misconduct are notoriously low.</p>", "<p>The sexual assault numbers in Uber's report cover a wide range of allegations. Some of the claims ended up being investigated by police and criminally prosecuted. In other cases, Uber was unable to reach the person who reported the assault for more information.</p>", "<p>The victims were both riders and drivers. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/728005817/uber-to-start-banning-passengers-with-low-ratings\">passengers</a> were accused of sexual assault in nearly half the reports.</p>", "<p data-pym-loader data-child-src=\"https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/uber-assault-parties-20191204/\" id=\"responsive-embed-uber-assault-parties-20191204\"> Loading... </p>", "<p><a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/uber-assault-parties-20191204?mode=childlink&amp;utm_source=nprnews&amp;utm_medium=app&amp;utm_campaign=storyredirect\"><em><strong>Don't see the graphic above?

Eight victims were riders, seven were Uber drivers and four were third parties, such as people outside the cars.</p>", "<p>Uber considers a fatal assault as related to Uber if it involved at least one person using the app \u2014 either a rider or driver \u2014 or if it involved people paired by the Uber app and took place within 48 hours of the ride.</p>", "<p><strong>Is Uber more or less safe than a taxi?</strong></p>", "<p>A question the report does not answer is how Uber's safety record compares with other forms of transportation.</p>", "<p>There are no national statistics for how many sexual assaults or deaths happen in U.S. taxis each year.</p>", "<p>Taxis are typically regulated by individual cities, and most police departments do not track whether sexual assaults involve a particular company or type of work, said John Boit, executive vice president of the Transportation Alliance, a trade group that represents taxi and limousine companies.</p>", "<p>The data that are available are hard to compare directly with Uber's report. San Francisco's transportation regulator tracks complaints about taxis, mainly through the city's 311 hotline. In 2017, for example, San Francisco received 14 reports of violence or physical altercations and four reports of accidents involving injury.</p>", "<p>But the city does not separate out sexual assault complaints. And without knowing the total number of rides taken in San Francisco taxis in that year, it is impossible to calculate how often such incidents occur.</p>", "<p>As for the 107 people killed in crashes involving an Uber vehicle in the two years covered by the report, that compares with 74,033 people in total killed in crashes on U.S. roads during that period, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>", "<p>Uber's fatality rate per mile driven was about half the national rate, according to the NHTSA, in each year of the report.</p>", "<p><strong>Weighing safety and privacy</strong></p>", "<p>In the past two years, Uber has introduced a number of safety features, including a \"panic button\" in its app that connects passengers and drivers to emergency services, using sensors in drivers' smartphones to detect possible crashes and performing continuous background checks of drivers.</p>", "<p>It is considering additional safety measures, including recording rides with audio or video and sharing with other ride-hailing companies the names of drivers who have been banned from its app for serious safety violations.</p>", "<p>These newest proposals raise questions about how Uber will balance the safety of passengers and drivers with their rights to privacy.</p>", "<p>Sharing the names of banned drivers could help prevent a driver banned for groping, for example, from simply switching over to driving for rival Lyft.</p>", "<p>\"We're committed to doing that in a way that's fair and that is compliant with the law,\" West said. \"But we think it is important that if someone is not deemed to be safe on our platform that that information is shared with others.\"</p>", "<p>The company already shares this information in Chicago, where local law requires ride-hailing apps to notify city officials when they ban a driver for reasons including complaints of sexual misconduct and physical assault. The city then passes those names on to other ride-hailing companies.</p>", "<p>That could flag drivers who behave unsafely or inappropriately, even if their behavior does not violate the law. Allegations may not be corroborated the way they would be in a criminal case, however, and it is unclear how much information another company would require to ban a driver for behavior conducted while using a different app.</p>", "<p>Uber is also testing audio recording in some cities in Latin America and video recording in Texas. It allows either drivers or passengers to initiate recordings. They can choose to send the file to Uber but cannot access or save it for themselves.</p>", "<p>Many critics have pushed for Uber to require cameras in cars.</p>", "<p>\"Having a dashboard camera for these rides would, I think, prevent a substantial portion of the assaults from happening,\" said Rachel Abrams, a lawyer in San Francisco whose firm represents victims of sexual assault on ride-hailing apps.</p>", "<p>But rolling out such recordings more widely will require navigating privacy and notification laws that differ across states and countries.</p>", "<p>Uber is the first ride-hailing company to publicly release its safety data. Lyft has also said it is working on a report.</p>", "<p>In the meantime, victims of sexual assault are taking their claims against Uber <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/12/759876637/lawsuits-say-lyft-doesnt-do-enough-to-protect-women-from-predator-drivers\">and Lyft</a> to court.

In the past, many people hadn't put a lot of stock in local forecasts because they were often wrong. But in 2008, when the radar had been up and running for a few years, there was a storm in the region. The local meteorologists could see from the radar data that the storm was parked over the neighboring province. They put out a forecast warning people there that flooding was likely for the next two days, so they should make sure their cattle were safe and avoid low-lying places.</p>", "<p>Indeed, the storm did exactly as they predicted.</p>", "<p>\"And everyone was really impressed,\" Mausse remembers and laughs. \"They were, like, 'Are you talking to God with that thing?' \"</p>", "<p>But shortly after that, according to the National Institute of Meteorology, the radar started to malfunction. It was difficult to keep calibrated and hard to fix because the company that made it, Gematronik, was in Germany.

He sent her hundreds of threatening messages. He contacted her friends, family and even work colleagues on Facebook to spread vicious lies about her \u2014 and that wasn't all. One night she opened her laptop to find email after email containing intimate pictures of her, including a graphic video filmed without her consent. Goldberg, a lawyer, went to the police and was told there was nothing that could be done. <br> <br>Thousands of dollars in legal fees and a restraining order later, Carrie Goldberg has turned her traumatic experience into a career. She started her own firm to represent people who, like her, have been the targets of this kind of abuse \u2014 and she's written a new book: <em>Nobody's Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls</em>.</p>", "<p>The book covers a range of situations, from a client who was impersonated on a gay dating site by an ex-boyfriend claiming he had rape fantasies, to a woman who was stalked by her ex, who ended up sending bomb threats to Jewish community centers all over the country. But Goldberg says most cases of nonconsensual porn involve women. \"Almost every sextortion case I've ever heard about are women or girls,\" she says.</p>", "<p><strong>On what happens to people who are targets of revenge porn</strong></p>", "<p>So when it comes to images, I mean, we've had clients that have been fired from their job because of naked pictures being on the Internet. We just got contacted by a teacher who was forced out of her job because a student reported that they had found a picture of her on a porn Web site. And one of the other things that really is traumatic for victims is that there's a huge consumer base of non-consensual porn who share detailed personal information with one another. And so there's there's a lot of stalking by strangers of the victims.</p>", "<p><strong>On what would make the situation better </strong></p>", "<p>Well, I think that we need to be able to hold our platforms liable for the harms that they cause. Right now there's absolutely no pressure on Facebook, on Twitter, on these humongous companies that so profit from our communication and our data. They have no pressure from the marketplace to be creating products that are responsibly designed. I feel that our court systems are designed to be the great equalizer. You know, just for the cost of an index number, my client, who might not have a penny to her name, could sue Jeff Bezos. Or in one case, my 13-year-old client sued the New York City Department of Education, a multi-multi-billion dollar entity. And when we as individuals ... can't get justice against a company, what incentive do they have to be creating anything that's that safe?</p>", "<p><strong>On the free speech argument</strong></p>", "<p>This isn't about speech ... this [is] about conduct. And when activists and libertarians conflate everything as speech and think that, you know ... they used to make this argument with non-consensual porn, that if we criminalize that, then we would lose all speech on the Internet. And now, you know, we have 46 states that have criminal revenge porn laws. And I think speech is still pretty robust. But there has to be limits. You know, we're talking about criminal actions, terroristic threats, deepfakes, people being impersonated and their lives being completely overturned. This isn't speech.</p>", "<p><strong>On advice for people who are experiencing this kind of harassment</strong></p>", "<p>My first piece of advice is is very practical: Don't delete anything, screenshot everything, on your phone, online. And then just recognize that you're not alone. In the back of my book, I have pages of of resources for everybody from victims of revenge porn to child sexual assault to sextortion, resources for the LGBTQ community. And I think that it's so important that victims and survivors have somebody that's on their side, you know, that they can tell, that they can confide in, because the scariest part of the entire process is feeling like you're under attack all by yourself. And the isolation.</p>", "<p><strong>On telling her own story in this book</strong></p>", "<p>It's empowering to have told my story. But I have to admit that there are moments of confusion and fear, and \"Oh my God, did I really put all of that in that book?\" And now, you know, when people tell me that they've read it, you know, there are parts of the book that I hadn't really talked about with almost anybody. ... But, you know, there is still some some discomfort with the fact that I've put all of this and all of these personal stories into the book. But I'm proud of it. And I feel that it's important. And one of the reasons I did it, you know, that I put so much personal information in it is because my clients give me everything. They tell me the most personal details of their stories. And then I put it into legal complaints, and those become public documents. And so, if they're being so willing and so trusting to expose themselves in order to advance their case and advance the law, then what am I doing if I'm not following that same model?</p>", "<p><em>This story was edited for radio by Janaya Williams and Natalie Winston Friedman, and adapted for the Web by Petra Mayer</em></p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

The same is true of cybercrime.</p>", "<p>Mark learned this the hard way in 2017. He runs a real estate company in Seattle and asked us not to include his last name because of the possible repercussions for his business.</p>", "<p>\"The idea that someone was effectively able to dupe you ... is embarrassing,\" he says. \"We're still kind of scratching our head over how it happened.\"</p>", "<p>It started when someone hacked into his email conversation with a business partner. But the hackers didn't take over the email accounts. Instead, they lurked, monitoring the conversation and waiting for an opportunity.</p>", "<p>When Mark and his partner mentioned a $50,000 disbursement owed to the partner, the scammers made their move.</p>", "<p>\"They were able to insert their own wiring instructions,\" he says. Pretending to be Mark's partner, they asked him to send the money to a bank account they controlled.</p>", "<p>\"The cadence and the timing and the email was so normal that it wasn't suspicious at all. It was just like we were continuing to have a conversation, but I just wasn't having it with the person I thought I was,\" Mark says.</p>", "<p>He didn't realize what had happened until his partner said he'd never gotten the money. \"Oh, it was just a cold sweat,\" he says.</p>", "<p>By the time they alerted the bank, the $50,000 was long gone, transferred overseas.</p>", "<p>It turned out Mark was on the vanguard of a growing wave of something called \"business email compromise,\" or BEC. It's a category of scam that uses phony emails to trick employees at companies to wire money to the wrong accounts. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center says reported <a href=\"https://pdf.ic3.gov/2018_IC3Report.pdf\">BEC amounted to more than $1.2 billion in 2018</a>, nearly triple the figure in 2016.</p>", "<p>\"The thing to keep in mind about these statistics is this is just what we're aware of,\" says James Abbott, a supervisory special agent with the FBI. \"This is just the victims that are reporting to the FBI.\"</p>", "<p>Some big losses have made the news in recent months, such as the <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/toyota-subsidiary-suffers-37m-bec/\">$37 million BEC scam suffered by a Toyota subsidiary</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/bec-scam-costing-almost-us-11-million-leads-to-fbi-arrest-of-nigerian-businessman\">$11 million lost by a U.K. office of Caterpillar</a>. But cybersecurity consultants say other losses have been kept quiet, even some worth millions of dollars. Companies want to avoid bad publicity, but this secrecy helps the scammers by keeping the threat under the radar. The next potential victims are less likely to expect such a sophisticated attack.</p>", "<p>\"What we've seen in 2019 is that the wave that's breaking is primarily focused around social engineering,\" says Patrick Peterson, CEO of Agari, a company that specializes in protecting corporate email systems. \"Social engineering\" is hacker-speak for scams that rely less on technical tricks and more on taking advantage of human vulnerabilities.</p>", "<p>\"It's not so much having the most sophisticated, evil technology. It's using our own trust and desire to communicate with others against us,\" Peterson says.</p>", "<p>In the past, scammers have pretended to be business partners and CEOs, urging employees to send money for an urgent matter. But lately there has been a trend toward what Agari calls \"vendor email compromise\" \u2014 scammers pretending to be part of a company's supply chain.</p>", "<p>Law enforcement is scrambling to keep up. In one recent operation, the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/281-arrested-worldwide-coordinated-international-enforcement-operation-targeting-hundreds\">FBI announced the arrest of 281 people</a> worldwide in connection with international BEC networks. Seventy-four of those arrests were in the U.S., and many were allegedly lower-level enablers of the scam \u2014 especially \"money mules.\" They're people in the U.S. who set up bank accounts to receive stolen money. American bank accounts are less likely to raise suspicion during a scam.</p>", "<p>\"It's a big deal across the country,\" says Miami attorney Nayib Hassan. \"And many people are getting caught up in it.\"</p>", "<p>Hassan says he has represented accused money mules in Texas, California and Florida. One defendant was a friend of his, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/miami-man-admits-laundering-more-15-million-proceeds-business-email-compromise-schemes\">Alfredo Veloso</a>, who was convicted and is now serving a federal sentence.</p>", "<p>\"In his mind, when it first got presented to him, it sounded possibly legitimate,\" Hassan says of how Veloso first agreed to become a money mule. He says Veloso may have convinced himself that someone somewhere had innocent reasons to move money quietly, perhaps to hide it from family.</p>", "<p>\"But then at some point, you understand that it's fraudulent,\" says Hassan. \"And he understood it.\"</p>", "<p>Many mules are recruited with the promise of easy cash \u2014 they usually keep some of the funds flowing through their bank accounts.

At first they're asked for loans, but later they can find themselves pressured to help the cybercrime network launder its money.</p>", "<p>\"Very often the victim has perhaps sent compromising photographs or may have moved money once or twice or something,\" says Wilson. \"When they say they want to get out, that's when they may be reminded, 'Hey, I have pictures of you. You moved this money through your bank account \u2014 you're part of this now.' \"</p>", "<p>Romance scams are lucrative in their own right. The FBI says Americans reported losing <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/media/2019/190805.aspx\">$362 million to romance and confidence scams last year</a>, a big jump over the $211 million reported the year before. And they can be just as sophisticated as BEC scams in the way they target and manipulate their victims.</p>", "<p>\"It's not something I would necessarily fall for,\" says Wilson. \"But the folks that get roped into these things are very carefully selected. They [the scammers] know, demographically, the people that are going to be the most susceptible.\"</p>", "<p>He says the fake online love interests use \"scripts,\" conversational gambits that have proved effective for keeping their victims on the hook.</p>", "<p>One victim was a divorc\u00e9e in Texas with children. She asked to stay anonymous because most people in her life don't know she was scammed. She says her fake love interest always seemed to know just what to say.</p>", "<p>\"Just very complimentary, understanding and ... someone who had a real interest in me, which was new to me,\" she says.</p>", "<p>When he asked her for money, she says she cried. She says she suspected he was a fraud, even as she sent him the funds.</p>", "<p>\"The best way I could describe it is you have two brains,\" she says. \"When you have this excitement or these feelings of love or passion. Because you know it's wrong, and you've read stories about it and people are telling you. You'd tell your best friend, 'You're crazy \u2014 don't do it!' But then you do it.\"</p>", "<p>The Texas romance scam victim bucked the trend and never was turned into a money mule. Instead, she got a warning from cybersecurity researchers at Agari, who'd been investigating a cybercrime gang in South Africa and saw it communicating with her.</p>", "<p>\"I had to <em>know </em>that they were a scammer,\" she says. And the warning from Agari \"was finally the evidence that proved that to me.\"</p>", "<p>In the end, she sent the scammers almost half a million dollars over three years. She lost her house and is now mired in debt. She's mystified by their powers of manipulation and considers her victimization a matter of \"brain chemistry.\"</p>", "<p>\"I believed everything that they told me,\" she says. \"It was ... a crime against everything that I thought I knew.

The much-hyped unveiling of the company's electric pickup truck went off script Thursday night when supposedly unbreakable window glass was smashed twice by a large metal ball.</p>", "<p>Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk showed off his company's all-electric \"Cybertruck\" on Thursday, touting its versatility and toughness. But the truck's unique design \u2014 it follows one angle from the front bumper to the top of the windshield, for instance \u2014 threw some Tesla fans for a loop. </p>", "<p>And during a demonstration to show off the truck's \"armor glass,\" the windows smashed.</p>", "<p>In typical Tesla style, the unveiling in Los Angeles included a countdown clock and an auditorium full of fans and journalists. The truck drove onto the stage through wafts of artificial smoke, and music drummed through loudspeakers. On the periphery, pyrotechnic flames rose as the vehicle stopped in front of a graffiti-style Cybertruck graphic, in stark black and white. </p>", "<p>Musk had teased several of the design cues ahead of the event, citing influences from <em>Bladerunner</em> to the James Bond movie <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em>. Both films featured vehicles with sharply angled front ends and overall wedge shapes \u2014 an approach to car design that's been seen as futuristic and aerodynamic since Alfa Romeo created the knifelike <a href=\"https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/cars/classic-concepts-1968-alfa-romeo-carabo\">Carabo</a> concept car in 1968. Others followed, such as Lamborghini's angular Countach and the Lotus Esprit, one of which was made into an amphibious vehicle for Roger Moore's James Bond \u2014 a car that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/tesla-elon-musk-james-bond-lotus-submarine-car\">Musk bought in 2013</a>.</p>", "<p>The front of the Cybertruck angles up to a point just above the front-seat headrests, where it meets an even longer slope down to the rear \u2014 a continuous plane that includes both a transparent roof panel and the truck's rolltop bed cover, which retracts behind the back seats.</p>", "<p>Musk seems to have expected the wedge-shaped design to split some potential customers, saying months before the truck's long-awaited unveiling that <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2019/03/15/tesla-cyberpunk-electric-pickup-truck-teaser-elon-musk/\">its look</a> \"may be too futuristic for most people.\" </p>", "<p>\n                Tesla unveiled its Cybertruck electric vehicle Thursday night.

After the much-hyped event, the company's fans were divided on the truck's aggressively angular design.</p>", "<p>The Cybertruck also looks markedly different from the truck concept improvised by Tesla owner Simone Giertz \u2014 who won fans earlier this year when she hacked off the back roof of a new Tesla Model 3 and converted the sedan into a truck. </p>", "<p>Giertz, who was at the Tesla event, said of the Cybertruck,\" I have no idea what I think of it. Need to sleep on it.\"</p>", "<p>On Friday, she elaborated somewhat: \"I've slept on it now, but my facial expression is still the same. I think I might have gotten chronic shocked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cybertruck?src=hashtag_click\">#Cybertruck</a> face.\"</p>", "<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This was my facial expression for the entire <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Tesla</a> event yesterday.

But the truck also had its defenders, who seem to chalk up the initial negative comments to the Cybertruck's bold look.</p>", "<p>\"Really disappointed by my colleagues at so many pubs who are dismissing the Cybertruck because it looks weird,\"  <em>Roadshow </em>Editor-in-Chief Tim Stevens <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Stevens/status/1197783753705185284\">said via Twitter</a>. He added, \"Many of these same colleagues spent this entire week lamenting an industry that is churning out samey, half-assed crossover SUVs. I'll take weird over anonymous.\"</p>", "<p>Twitter user David Wu <a href=\"https://twitter.com/libdave/status/1197750810261647361\">compared it to a stealth fighter</a>: \"The F35 of pickup trucks. Don't think my mind has ever been blown like this before.\"</p>", "<p>Tesla says the Cybertruck drives better than most sports cars and is more useful than a normal truck. From a standing start, the truck's maxed-out version can accelerate to 60 mph in 2.9 seconds, according to the company. And on paper at least, the pairing of electric motors \u2014 known for their high torque output \u2014 with a truck would seem to be a slam-dunk concept.</p>", "<p>But pickup trucks, like most automobiles, are also sold on image. And both Tesla and Musk have repeatedly played up the new electric truck's ruggedness.</p>", "<p>\"You want a truck that's really tough? Not fake tough?\" Musk asked the crowd  Thursday night. He also said Tesla will make the exterior of the Cybertruck from a stainless steel alloy developed by his companies. \"We're going to be using the same alloy in the Starship rocket,\" Musk said, referring to his SpaceX project. </p>", "<p>Then things went off track with the \"Tesla armor glass\" strength test. </p>", "<p>A metal ball was dropped onto a sheet of what Musk described as \"regular car glass,\" leaving a long crack.</p>", "<p>To test a sheet of Tesla's glass, the metal ball was taken up to a height of around 10 feet and dropped again. The \"armor glass\" remained intact. But Musk didn't stop there \u2014 he turned the ball over to Tesla's chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, who had previously whacked the truck's doors with a sledgehammer to show its durability.</p>", "<p>\"Franz, could you try to break this glass, please?\" Musk said.</p>", "<p>\"You sure?\" von Holzhausen asked.</p>", "<p>\"Yeah.\"</p>", "<p>Without much of a windup, von Holzhausen whirled the ball at Tesla's brand-new truck \u2014 leaving a nasty-looking spiderweb of splintered and dented glass.</p>", "<p>\"Well,\" Musk said afterward. \"Maybe that was a little too hard.\"</p>", "<p>Staring at the ruined window, one hand on his chin, Musk added, \"It didn't go through. That's the plus side.\"</p>", "<p>Then von Holzhausen asked if they should try the rear window. Musk agreed, and was soon standing in front of two pock-marked windows for the rest of the carefully stage-managed event.</p>", "<p>\"Not bad,\" Musk summed up that portion of the night, adding, \"Room for improvement.\"</p>", "<p>The Cybertruck has six seats and a cargo bed (or \"vault,\" as Tesla calls it) that's 6 1/2 feet long. Its tailgate also hides a ramp, for rolling materials or vehicles into the bed. The truck is 231.7 inches (19.3 feet) long, nearly 80 inches wide and 75 inches tall. Tesla lists its maximum range at more than 500 miles. </p>", "<p>The truck will be offered in a wide spectrum of driving range and weight capacity, depending on which motor is powering the vehicle. While the basic single-motor truck would have a range of around 250 miles and a tow rating of 7,500 pounds using rear-wheel drive, the three-motor all-wheel-drive version would double that range and be capable of towing 14,000 pounds, Tesla says.</p>", "<p>The starting price for the CyberTruck is $39,900. In the most high-powered version, it would cost $69,900. The company is taking preorders now, with a $100 deposit required to reserve a vehicle that Tesla says will hit the market in about two years.</p>", "<p>Perhaps reflecting the uncertainty over the new design, Tesla's stock price fell overnight and continued to dip on Friday, down by around 6% at midday ET. But as <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-dones-futures-tesla-cybertruck-splunk-ross-stores-pure-storage-earnings-movers/\">Investors Business Daily</a> notes, \"Since its June 3 low, Tesla stock has doubled.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

I'm thrilled people love these concerts as much as we love making them, but they sound <em>so</em> much better when played on a decent sound system, or on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2018/12/18/676559970/tiny-tech-tips-finding-the-perfect-headphones\">headphones</a>. Sure, the concerts sound OK on a mono phone speaker, but you'd be amazed by what you're missing once you've heard the audio mix on a device that can actually reproduce the low and high ends of the frequency spectrum, where all the chest-thumping bass and shimmering cymbals live.</p>", "<p>Thankfully, audio snobs need not look on in horror (as much) anymore: great-sounding, relatively affordable smart speakers are popping up everywhere. They're all convenient for barking questions at, like \"What's the weather on Friday,\" or, \"How many grams in a pound?\" (454, as it turns out.) These are decidedly <em>not </em>the hockey-puck shaped smart devices \u2014 with no bottom end, muffled highs and a jarring mid-range \u2014 currently littering the homes of family and friends. After spending a bunch of time listening to each one, I frankly couldn't choose a clear favorite \u2014 I just know they all sound better than what most people have in their homes.</p>", "<p>In addition to my own assessments, I asked a group of NPR audio engineers and producers to participate in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghMYzo0rgrw\">Pepsi Challenge</a>, to help distinguish the sound between four of the latest offerings from Sonos, Apple, Google and Amazon.</p>", "<p>I should note that it's possible to link any two of these units together to create a stereo pair, but I decided to test only one unit from each brand. After all, you may receive one as a gift, or buy one just to see if you like it. And not to fear, these companies make it easy to add more speakers later \u2014 though fair warning, I've learned that adding additional speakers is not only expensive, but habit-forming. (I mean if I'm honest, every room should have a speaker in it. And some rooms should have stereo pairs. And still others 5.1 surround. And I should be able to send any audio to any room all from my smartphone or tablet. Obviously.)</p>", "<p>Now, the elephant hiding in the corner of the room and taking notes here is the issue of privacy; Google's head of devices recently <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50048144\">recommended</a> disclosing the presence of smart speakers to your houseguests, while concerns have been raised over the devices eavesdropping <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/smart-speakers/smart-speakers-that-listen-when-they-shouldnt/\">without permission</a>. If you're worried about protecting your privacy but still intrigued, know that all of the device's have options for disabling their mics. You can also take a look at Mozilla's <a href=\"https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/smart-home/\">privacy-focused reviews</a> of the devices. And Sonos makes <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/symfonisk-table-lamp-with-wifi-speaker-black-00464617/\">options</a> without a mic, controlled only by the app.</p>", "<p>Let's dig in.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/move.html\"><strong>Sonos Move</strong></a><strong> ($400)</strong></p>", "<p>\n                The Sonos Move.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Mhari Shaw/NPR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p>Sonos was the first company to convince me that wireless audio can rival a home stereo in audio fidelity. In 2005, they were way ahead of the competition when they <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/24/sonos_comes_to_uk/\">released</a> the ZonePlayer 100 \u2014 which <a href=\"https://content.abt.com/documents/14663/zp100_data.pdf\">could</a> \"wireless stream and amplify your digital music all over the house.\"</p>", "<p>Now, with the release of the Move this year, Sonos continues their tradition of being in the tech-speaker vanguard. The Move's biggest appeal is right there in its name: It's the only speaker in this overview that is completely untethered from both audio <em>and</em> power cables, thanks to a built-in rechargeable battery.</p>", "<p>I could start my day with the Move in the bedroom, waking up to <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/\">NPR One</a>, then lift it off its included charging base via built-in handle and move it to the bathroom for an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlusJjoNN8\">underscored shower</a>, move it over to the kitchen to make breakfast, then <em>move</em> it up to my building's rooftop to stream my yoga podcast via Bluetooth. It's kind of like getting four speakers in one \u2014 if you're willing, that is, to... you get it. Sonos can also play nice with both Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant, just not at the same time. Dedicated touch controls on the top of the speaker allow you to play/pause, swipe to skip forward or back and mute the mics. If you hold down the play/pause button on an inactive speaker, whatever is playing on another Sonos speaker on your network will magically start playing. Sonos supports <a href=\"https://support.sonos.com/s/article/3459?language=en_US\">countless</a> music and news streaming services without playing favorites, unlike Apple, Google and Amazon.</p>", "<p>The Move has a very balanced sound that comes from one mid-woofer and one downward-firing tweeter, with a wider soundscape than the (excellent-sounding) Sonos One \u2014which is half the price, but tethered by its power cable. The Move uses Sonos' auto-tuning feature, <a href=\"https://support.sonos.com/s/article/3251?language=en_US\">Trueplay</a>, automatically every time it's moved \u2014 with other Sonos speakers, you need the iOS version of the app to tune the devices, via your iPhone's mic. You can, however, adjust the treble, bass and loudness in the dedicated Sonos App for both iOS and Android on all of their devices.</p>", "<p>If you already have a Sonos system, the Move is a convenient and portable addition to their lineup. The battery will last for about 10 hours and it's replaceable (huzzah!). It also supports Apple's AirPlay, so you can beam audio directly from your Apple device. And if you have a <a href=\"https://www.audio-technica.com/cms/turntables/d41892c53111caf9/index.html\">Bluetooth-streaming record player</a>, you can play it through the Move too, like any other Bluetooth source. Alas, it's missing an aux-in jack, though does have a USB-C port for charging when the base isn't around. It comes in just one color, an industrial greyish black, and it's the only speaker on this list with a metal grill instead of fabric. It's built to take a beating, and get splashed on every now and again too, with an IP56 rating protecting against dust and water. All of this makes it the most expensive smart speaker on the list.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/homepod/\"><strong>Apple HomePod</strong></a><strong> ($300)</strong></p>", "<p>\n                Apple's HomePod.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Mhari Shaw/NPR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p>What distinguishes HomePod from the other speakers here is that it is idiot-proof: No matter where you place it in the room, you're guaranteed to be in the sweet spot. In fact, there is no sweet spot \u2014 even if you're behind it. HomePod tunes itself to its surroundings, so if it's in a corner, it retunes itself to fire sound in the opposite direction of the wall, automatically attenuating booming bass levels as well. It's HomePod's killer app.</p>", "<p>Seven \"<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/homepod/\">beamforming</a>\" tweeters are evenly spaced out on the bottom perimeter of the speaker, which allows sound to bounce off whatever surface it's on. The \"high-excursion\" \u2014 again, their word \u2014 woofer is on top, thus avoiding the possibility of rattling anything nearby.</p>", "<p>But the tradeoff with Apple's intuitive setup is \u2014 and this may not come as a surprise \u2014 a lack of customization options. There's no way to adjust bass or treble, though HomePod sounds balanced no matter where you place it. If you like Siri as a virtual assistant and you're entrenched in Apple's unrivaled digital \"ecosystem,\" this is a great-sounding, no-fuss speaker. And, being from Apple, it looks great; HomePod is elegant and blends in well, especially in white.</p>", "<p>The touch controls on the top of HomePod are intuitive. Tap once to play/pause, double tap to skip forward and triple tap to skip back. There are dedicated volume buttons, but there's no hardware option to disable the mics (you can disable Siri in the Home app). The power cord isn't replaceable, like the other speakers on this list. Most unfortunately, there are no Bluetooth or line-in options either, so getting your growing vinyl collection to play through the HomePod isn't an option. Also Android users also need not apply, though there is <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.screen.mirroring.airplay.streamtotv&amp;hl=en_US\">unofficial software</a> available that supposedly works for Airplay (I didn't test this software). And speaking of Airplay, you can stream any application running on iOS to HomePod, like Spotify or Tidal, but having an Apple Music account is essential for barking musical requests at the smart part of this speaker.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/google_home_max\"><strong>Google Home Max</strong></a><strong> ($250)</strong></p>", "<p>\n                Google's Home Max.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Mhari Shaw/NPR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p>Two woofers and two tweeters make this thing sound as big as it looks \u2014 which is saying something, since it's about twice the size and weight of the others we tested. You can feel the low end in your gut and there's decent stereo spread if you position yourself a few feet in front of it. It ships in white (\"chalk\") and black (\"charcoal\") and uses lights under the grill to indicate volume and that it's listening to commands. Around back, there's a dedicated switch to mute the mics and a USB-C port that can charge any device. You can also connect to the speaker via aux-in or Bluetooth, though it (unsurprisingly) stops short of integrating support for Apple's AirPlay.</p>", "<p>The device uses <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UiBhshQ0FQA\">smart sound</a> to calibrate itself, just like HomePod and Move, so room placement isn't super critical. Thankfully, this massive speaker can be placed vertically (mono) or horizontally (stereo), and its clever touch-activated surface knows which way is up. The audio sums to mono when the speaker is vertical due to the position of the four drivers inside. When horizontal, there's some stereo spread, and you can slide your finger across the top to adjust volume. Slide left, the volume lowers, and the lights under the speaker grill show you how much. It sounds minor, but it's so nice to have a visual representation of volume right on the front of the speaker. (It also made this Gen X-er nostalgic for Kit, the car from the '80s TV show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNyXYPhnUIs\"><em>Knight Rider</em></a>, co-starring <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/08/777155039/david-hasselhoff-is-still-big-in-germany-30-years-after-his-berlin-wall-show\">David Hasselhoff</a>.)</p>", "<p>When it comes to smart assistants, you can use... Google. That's it \u2014 Siri and Alexa won't help you here. Streaming service setup is easy enough, though: Once you're logged into your accounts, you can ask the Max to natively access Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn and iHeartRadio. Apple Music on the Google Home Max? You're out of luck. But with the inclusion of Bluetooth and aux-in, it's possible \u2014 you just can't ask Google Assistant to play it for you.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC\"><strong>Amazon Echo Studio</strong></a><strong> ($200)</strong></p>", "<p>\n                Amazon's Echo Studio.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Mhari Shaw/NPR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p>The first time I played around with an Amazon Echo, I remember thinking Alexa was a very cool party trick, but thought it would never catch on. As a self-proclaimed audio snob, I just couldn't get past the subpar sound quality. Enter Echo Studio.</p>", "<p>What's surprising is that Amazon has upped the sonic ante, too, with \"3D Music.\" With a subscription to Amazon Music HD ($13-15 per month), you get access to countless songs <a href=\"http://news.dolby.com/en-WW/183727-dolby-and-warner-music-group-to-expand-music-available-in-dolby-atmos\">remastered</a> for <a href=\"https://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-atmos.html\">Dolby Atmos</a>, and what they've achieved from a single box seems impossible, with sound seeming to come from an entire wall rather than a single point source. I'm very curious to learn what mixing a Tiny Desk concert for this system might sound like in the future, but I'm a sucker for tried-and-true stereo and turned off Echo Studio's enhanced sound setting for this review.</p>", "<p>There are five directional speakers inside the Echo Studio: one on top, two on either side firing out, one facing front and a subwoofer firing down. What does that get you? <a href=\"https://itstillworks.com/info-12129970-stereo-separation.html\">Stereo separation</a>! Of all the speakers I tested, none could reproduce stereo imaging like the Echo Studio. However, there was a dead zone directly behind the device \u2014 I'd love to see a sixth speaker added in the back to fill that space. The speaker also features \"Automatic Room Adaptation,\" Amazon's version of room calibration, which uses the mics to automatically tune the speaker. Just like the others.</p>", "<p>In addition to Wi-Fi, you can stream audio to the Echo Studio via Bluetooth, or connect a device via aux input. AirPlay is not supported; however you can summon Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, Siriusxm, iHeartRadio, Pandora and Tidal with your voice. If the Echo Studio had AirPlay, a built-in battery and a handle (like the Sonos Move) plus a sixth speaker around back (like the HomePod), it would be the ultimate smart speaker.</p>", "<p>I like the sound coming out of all these speakers, and I'm relieved that tech companies are making strides to improve fidelity. But sound quality is subjective, so I sat down with four NPR producers and engineers in front of these smart speakers for a blind listening test:</p>", "<p>What follows are the unedited first impressions of these NPR staffers after listening to 30-second-long clips of the following audio:</p>", "<p><strong>No. 1: Sonos Move</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Natasha: </strong>Overall, nice tonal balance, if a little mid-forward. Great for dialogue-heavy listening. No stereo soundstage, but good separation of elements, nonetheless.</p>", "<p><strong>Suraya:</strong> <em>Up First</em> \u2014 boomy mids. Jupiter \u2014 mono, dull, mid-range-y, with harsh highs. \"Money\" \u2014 needs a better bottom. \"Tempo\" \u2014 low-end is not good.</p>", "<p><strong>Bob: </strong>Quite clear. Nice highs. Not enough depth on classical. Average sound, musically. Nice highs, mids just okay.<strong> </strong></p>", "<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> This thing gets loud! No distortion noted. Good low-end/frequency response. Mono. Still a little boxy-ness.</p>", "<p><strong>No. 2: Apple HomePod</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Natasha: </strong>The lower to mid-range frequencies (where bass and floor toms live) sound muddy to my ears. It's all a bit of a wash, with no depth or separation between elements. Though there's no stereo spread here, it is nice that elements don't drop out as you move around the room.</p>", "<p><strong>Suraya:</strong> <em>Up First</em> \u2014 I like the sense of space. Jupiter \u2014 not bad, pretty good frequency response. \"Money\" \u2014 warmer low-end, but I might want to EQ it. \"Tempo\" - mid and high frequencies too prominent.</p>", "<p><strong>Bob: </strong>Very natural sound. Good bass balance. Good top end. Nice depth. Bass not as deep as others, but that wasn't a minus. Rock sounds great.</p>", "<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Not as loud as No. 1. No distortion noted. Not boxy, but not crisp. Mild stereo separation on \"Money.\"</p>", "<p><strong>No. 3: Google Home Max</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Natasha: </strong>The highs and lows are emphasized too much for my taste, but this could be exciting for movie viewing or casual listening. I'm happy to hear a stereo image, but it's quite narrow, and there's really only room for one person in the sweet spot.</p>", "<p><strong>Suraya:</strong> <em>Up First</em> \u2014 almost phase-y <em>[Ed. note: Meaning washed out and hollow sounding] </em>Jupiter \u2014 crispy high end. \"Money\" \u2014 decent left-right imaging, pretty smooth frequency response. \"Tempo\" \u2014 vocals too prominent, bass decent.</p>", "<p><strong>Bob: </strong>Not well-balanced. Big bottom. Spatially, not much separation. Classical sounds good. Rock sounds very good. Lizzo sounds good.</p>", "<p><strong>Kevin: </strong>As loud as No. 1, no distortion noted. Not as good a frequency spread as No. 1. Mild stereo separation, a touch wider than No. 2.</p>", "<p><strong>No. 4: Amazon Echo Studio</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Natasha: </strong>Enjoyable tonal balance here, and I'm hearing low-level details, like reverb tails, for the first time. Greater stereo spread than No. 3, but the center image sometimes seems to emanate from the back of the device.</p>", "<p><strong>Suraya:</strong> <em>Up First</em> \u2014 too much midrange. Jupiter \u2014 best stereo separation. \"Money\" \u2014 best left-right imaging. Needs a cut at 400 hz <em>[Ed. note: you can use EQ to cut out the tubbiness at 400 kHz]</em> \"Tempo\" \u2014 decent low end, voice too loud.</p>", "<p><strong>Bob: </strong>Sounds good \u2014 voice is natural. Classical had a good, big sound. Stereo sound welcome! Very balanced. Good bass.</p>", "<p><strong>Kevin: </strong>Louder than No. 3, no distortion noted. Sounds like mono sound is coming out of the side. Mild stereo separation, widest of the bunch. Frequency response flat like No. 2. Not as good as No. 1.</p>", "<p><strong>Josh Rogosin: </strong><em>My</em> take? The Google Home Max and Amazon Echo Studio make valiant attempts at stereo in one package, but I'd personally rather have a Sonos speaker that just does mono well. When I can afford it, I can always add a matching paired speaker for an authentic stereo experience.</p>", "<p>Sound quality aside, the most important factor in buying or gifting one of these products is the ecosystem you're joining, or forcing someone else to join. Choose the speaker that works with the services that you use. If you don't have a preference and are entering the market for the first time, then consider budget and, if you can afford to, set up two speakers as a stereo pair. Willing to ditch the mics and voice assistants? A pair of <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/symfonisk-wifi-bookshelf-speaker-black-00357561/\">Sonos/Ikea</a> bookshelf speakers only costs about $200. (But at half the price, they won't sound quite as full-bodied.)</p>", "<p>Smart speakers have made big strides in sound quality with this current crop of offerings. While there are certainly cheaper options available, I would encourage anyone to spend the extra money on one of the better-sounding devices. And there's certainly no shortage of quality audio content available, much of it offered for free and/or ad-supported, from great organizations.

Sarah Mackin of the Boston Public Health Commission prepares the machine for testing some samples.</p>", "<p>Sarah Mackin runs a cotton swab around the inside of a tiny plastic baggie that appears to be empty. She spreads whatever residue the swab picked up onto a test strip that resembles a Band-Aid, then slides the strip into a buzzing machine about the size of a boxed, take-home pie. Then she waits, hoping for information that she can share with Boston's community of opioid users.</p>", "<p>Mackin is using an MX908, a <a href=\"https://www.broadinstitute.org/proteomics/what-mass-spectrometry\">mass spectrometer</a> initially marketed as a counterterrorism tool. The machine can help military teams looking for traces from biological or chemical weapons, or hazardous material specialists trying to identify materials used in spills or explosions. But now the MX908 has been commandeered in the fight against fentanyl, one of Boston's \u2014 and the nation's \u2014 top killers.</p>", "<p>The machine rapidly analyzes a sample of drugs, and can detect and identify dozens of types of fentanyl \u2014 a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/fentanyl.html\">synthetic opioid</a> which is fifty times more potent than heroin. Fentanyl is increasingly mixed with heroin and cocaine, often without the user's knowledge, and has become a major contributor <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/pbss/PBSS-Report-072017.pdf\">to fatal drug overdoses</a> in recent years.<strong> </strong></p>", "<p>It's too early to know how helpful the MX908 could be in lowering the mortality rate in the country's ongoing drug abuse epidemic. But that's why Mackin, the director of harm reduction services at the Boston Public Health Commission, is field-testing the machine.</p>", "<p>Mackin looks down at a screen that spans the top of the MX908 and taps an icon labeled \"drug hunter.\"</p>", "<p>\n                A swab is used to take an initial trace sample of the substance in the bag, prior to testing with the MX908.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Jesse Costa/WBUR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">A swab is used to take an initial trace sample of the substance in the bag, prior to testing with the MX908.</p>", "<p>\"This is something that was sold as heroin,\" Mackin says, dangling the baggie as the machine whirs through its cycle. The MX908 can identify 70 specific types of fentanyl in a tiny sample, and alert users about the presence of more than 2,000 not-yet-named fentanyl analogues.</p>", "<p>It also detects the presence of MDMA, cocaine and meth \u2014 all based on tiny samples left at the tip of a needle, or even wiped onto a cotton ball. About 30 seconds after starting the test, Mackin watches red and yellow warning symbols flash across the screen.</p>", "<p>\"Oh yeah,\" Mackin says, nodding her head. \"So, there's multiple kinds of opioid analgesics and multiple kinds of synthetic fentanyls in this sample that was sold as 'heroin.' It's kind of an example of what the drug landscape looks like here.\"</p>", "<p>The illicit street drugs sold in Boston probably crossed international borders. They may have been cut and remixed multiple times as they moved along the supply chain. Drug users rarely know for sure what they are buying. Drug-testing devices like the MX908 can help identify additives that raise the risk of overdose.</p>", "<p>Take the experience of a woman named Bri. (NPR is only using Bri's first name because she uses illegal drugs.) One day last July, Bri brought in residue from some of her drugs when the machine was set up in downtown Boston. On that day, she had three different samples. Bri had already overdosed on a hit from one of the bags.</p>", "<p>\"That's why I wanted it tested,\" Bri says. \"I thought there was carfentanil in it.\"</p>", "<p>Carfentanil, sometimes called the elephant tranquilizer, shows up in the Boston drug supply sporadically, along with other increasingly powerful and deadly forms of fentanyl.</p>", "<p>In Bri's case, one of her samples showed no trace of drugs at all, one tested positive for a medical-grade fentanyl, and the third showed traces of a substance in the potency range of carfentanil.</p>", "<p>\n                The MX908 detects the possible presence of fentanyl in a drug sample.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Jesse Costa/WBUR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">The MX908 detects the possible presence of fentanyl in a drug sample.</p>", "<p>\"Now, I'm going to be honest,\" Bri says. \"If I was sick and I had one bag of dope on me and you told me there's carfentanil in there, I'm not going to lie and say I wouldn't use it. But I would know to not put the entire thing in.\"</p>", "<p>Bri says she knows ingesting that particular sample would be a very risky move. But with that knowledge, there are steps she can take to reduce the risk of death: She can use the drugs in the presence of a buddy who can observe her for signs of overdose. Bri also carries around naloxone, a drug used to quickly reverse an opioid overdose.</p>", "<p>These precautions can help Bri moderate her risk of overdose, and <a href=\"https://americanhealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Fentanyl_Executive_Summary_032018.pdf\">research shows </a>that is one main way that drug testing saves lives \u2014 whether it's done through a machine like the MX908 or lower-tech methods like fentanyl test strips.</p>", "<p><strong>The value of drug-checking</strong></p>", "<p>Another way drug checking can save lives is by alerting local authorities, like the Boston Public Health Commission, that deadly concentrations of opioids have been found in the local drug supply.</p>", "<p>It's complicated, however. Addiction is such a powerful disease that such warnings might actually serve as unwitting advertisements, alerting people who are seeking an ever-more powerful high.</p>", "<p>But <a href=\"https://vivo.brown.edu/display/tcgreen\">Traci Green,</a> who is a researcher in emergency medicine at Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University, says her own research, as well as some European studies, show that drug-testing is ultimately beneficial: When drug users have the power to test what they buy, they seek out drug dealers with the safest supply.</p>", "<p>\"So this improvement in consumer knowledge and confidence in what they're getting, and how to use it, can improve the safety of the larger supply,\" Green says.</p>", "<p>Green will evaluate this trial run of the MX908 in Boston. She says she's especially interested in learning whether its deployment can attract hard-to-reach drug users, the ones who traditionally avoid contact with any institutions or medical care. Access to the MX908 might bring them into a setting where they begin to interact with outreach workers, and possibly begin a conversation about treatment.</p>", "<p><strong>A steep price tag and legal issues</strong></p>", "<p>One other city, Chicago, is also testing the MX908 as a harm reduction tool for the opioid crisis. But there are reasons why it may not be more widely adopted. One is the price tag: $65,000.</p>", "<p>In Boston, the city paid for the device through a grant from RIZE Massachusetts, a foundation focused on combating the opioid epidemic.</p>", "<p>\"Cost is one concern,\" says RIZE CEO <a href=\"https://rizema.org/about/\">Julie Burns</a>. \"But what is the value of a human life? If we decide through the evaluation that this is something that is reducing overdoses, I believe it is worth the investment.\"</p>", "<p>Still, there are cheaper ways to find out if a drug baggie contains fentanyl.</p>", "<p>Street outreach workers have been <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2017/05/11/fentanyl-test-strips\">distributing fentanyl test strips</a>, which cost about $1 apiece, for more than two years. The current Massachusetts state budget includes $150,000 to expand access to these test strips.</p>", "<p>Like the MX908, the strips show the presence or absence of fentanyl \u2014 though the machine can offer much greater detail, as well as information about the presence of several types of stimulants.<strong> </strong>(Neither the machine nor the test strips can reveal how much fentanyl is in a baggie.)</p>", "<p>\n                A fentanyl test strip is used to detect fentanyl in a drug sample. Such test strips cost about $1 apiece.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Jesse Costa/WBUR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">A fentanyl test strip is used to detect fentanyl in a drug sample. Such test strips cost about $1 apiece.</p>", "<p>For now, harm reduction programs will have to decide which drug testing tool is most cost-effective, based on their goals and budget, says <a href=\"https://anypositivechange.org/staff-team/\">Greg Scott, </a>who leads the Chicago Recovery Alliance, or CRA. The CRA began an extensive drug-checking program in March that includes two MX908s.</p>", "<p>Scott says so far, the MX908 is delivering on two goals: helping people use drugs more safely and offering real-time information about the drug supply in Chicago. But Scott says unless drug checking becomes much more widespread, it won't force drug dealers and suppliers to \"clean up\" the drug supply.</p>", "<p>\"Getting to that scale and that level of impact is a very costly endeavor,\" Scott says.</p>", "<p>Another reason public health workers may hesitate to use the MX908 is that doing so may be illegal in their jurisdiction.</p>", "<p>\"Drug checking is a legal gray area,\" says Northeastern University law professor <a href=\"https://www.northeastern.edu/law/faculty/directory/beletsky.html\">Leo Beletsky</a>. \"There are provisions in Massachusetts law and the laws of pretty much every other state that might be interpreted to consider drug checking devices as 'drug paraphernalia.' \"</p>", "<p>That includes fentanyl test strips. Illinois <a href=\"http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?GAID=15&amp;SessionID=108&amp;GA=101&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;DocNum=1828&amp;LegID=119441&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session=\">enacted legislation</a> in August that exempts people who test their drugs from prosecution. In Massachusetts, lawmakers are reviewing a proposal to make use of drug-checking tools legal.</p>", "<p>Boston police say they aren't involved in the MX908 pilot and referred questions to the city's public health commission. The U.S. attorney's office in Massachusetts declined a request for their perspective on the use of this device for public health purposes.</p>", "<p>The MX908 is also used in more traditional ways by police, fire and hazmat teams across Massachusetts. Even they have found that the leading enemy agent is fentanyl, says David DiGregorio, who directs the hazardous materials emergency response division at the Massachusetts Department of Fire Services. His department has about a dozen of the machines.</p>", "<p>\"If you had asked me if I was going to be involved in drugs five years ago I would have said, 'No, it's not my job.' It's become my job,\" DiGregorio says. \"Hazmat calls are up in the last two years, exponentially, and a lot of that has to do with drug calls, because we can identify these powders in the field.\"</p>", "<p><em>This story is part of a reporting partnership that includes</em> WBUR, <em>NPR and </em><a href=\"http://khn.org/\">Kaiser Health News</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

For that money, she was expected to go to the store, shop, fill a cart and deliver an order, sometimes driving 10 or 15 miles.</p>", "<p>\"I thought, 'Now listen, this is less than minimum wage you want me to drive [for],' \" Fortier says. After seven months of working for Instacart in west Michigan, she quit the gig in October.</p>", "<p>Millions of Americans like Fortier have counted on platforms like Instacart, DoorDash, Uber or Lyft not just as a service but as a job.

The company relies on more than 130,000 people to log on and help strangers with their groceries. As NPR first <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/722811953/why-suburban-moms-are-delivering-your-groceries\">reported in May</a>, the majority of them are women.

At the heart of their frustration are the constant and murky changes to how the company assigns work and determines its value.</p>", "<p>\"It was extremely clear before how much you would be paid per item, how much you would be paid per order,\" says Liz Temkin, 63, who has worked for Instacart in Los Angeles for over four years. \"And then they came up with a completely different what we call a black box algorithm.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Value of work</strong></p>", "<p>An Instacart representative declined to speak on the record but pointed out that in February, the company did commit to a guaranteed minimum pay: $7 to $10 per job.</p>", "<p>This one job can vary from a quick grocery run to a big stock-up at Costco. Or it might mean multiple orders compiled together \u2014 delivering several payments to Instacart and one to the worker \u2014 though Instacart says its pay does account for the size, weight, distance and other factors of all the included orders.</p>", "<p>\"We used to get $10 to go to the store and 40 cents an item. Now, no matter how many items and how many units we get, they pay us $7. Maybe there's a tip; maybe there's not,\" says Mercedes Maltese, 42, who joined Instacart in 2017 in a suburb of Detroit after losing full- and part-time jobs in succession.</p>", "<p>\n                NPR connected with more than 40 current or former Instacart contractors.

However, Instacart also does not pay for the drive <em>to </em>the store \u2014 only from the store to the customer \u2014 and so Maltese spends much of her workday sitting in her car, unpaid, waiting for a decent order.</p>", "<p>\"I work ... seven days a week,\" she says, her voice swelling with tears. \"I just have to work and live in my car like a homeless person, in some kind of hopes of scraping up some kind of money in order to pay my bills.\"</p>", "<p>In interviews, Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta often brings up the difficulty of constantly matching the supply and demand of grocery orders to workers. His company, expected to go public as soon as next year, is valued at nearly $8 billion. In May, Mehta <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/instacart-ceo-apoorva-mehta-were-ready-for-split-from-whole-foods.html\">told CNBC</a> that Instacart is profitable on every delivery.</p>", "<p>Like Uber in ride-hailing, Instacart grew nationwide thanks to algorithms assigning and putting value on work \u2014 and to a virtually unlimited pool of workers giving the app a try. In August, Instacart said its worker ranks almost tripled in one year.</p>", "<p><strong>Algorithmic control</strong></p>", "<p>\"Algorithmic despotism\" was the term that sociologists applied to Instacart in <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023119870041\">an August paper</a>. The researchers found that the company stood out among competing apps for just how much it pushed workers to commit long hours and accept unattractive gigs.</p>", "<p>\"Instacart, we found in particular, really did control the labor process or control workers' experiences and limited their autonomy over their time and over the work they could do in a significant way,\" lead author Kathleen Griesbach of Columbia University told NPR.</p>", "<p>\n                Teri Smith knits a pair of socks in a Kroger parking lot in Arlington, Texas, while she waits for Instacart to offer her a new grocery order.

A company spokesperson did not address the research on the record but pointed out that its contractors now can work more flexibly \"on demand\" \u2014 grabbing assignments whenever, as orders come in \u2014 in addition to signing up for the two-hour shifts featured in the study.</p>", "<p>The majority of the 40-some workers who communicated with NPR said they worked both the old way and the new way \u2014 and either way, being faster, nicer or more experienced did not guarantee better pay.</p>", "<p>The shift system has various rules for getting or <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-15/instacart-hounds-workers-to-take-jobs-that-aren-t-worth-it\">even rejecting</a> work.

They rush against each other to snatch up orders, with little time to thoroughly calculate whether shopping and delivering is worth time, gas and extra miles on their cars.</p>", "<p>\"Trying to quickly analyze and make an educated decision ... is next to impossible,\" says Cynthia Phillips, 58, who has been shopping for Instacart in Southern California for almost two years. Instacart \"gets to pay less and less for services knowing that someone will end up taking the batch.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Opaque changes</strong></p>", "<p>Instacart workers' <a href=\"https://sf.eater.com/2019/11/4/20947832/instacart-shoppers-strike\">latest strike</a> this month was over changes to tipping, which workers say is still a hefty chunk of their income. Instacart used to set a default tip of 10% per order, but now it's half that. Meanwhile, the tip is in addition to a delivery fee and a service fee that both go to Instacart.</p>", "<p>The subject of tipping is particularly sensitive for Instacart workers. In February, the company had to <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/after-scrutiny-instacart-will-end-its-controversial-tipping\">refund workers</a> after they noticed that Instacart was using their tips to subsidize the minimum payment it promised.</p>", "<p>\n                Smith loads an Instacart customer's groceries in the back of her van. \"I actually love grocery shopping,\" she says. \"The only thing I'm asking for is to be paid fairly.\"\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Allison V.

Workers point out that for many of them, this bonus had already been a downgrade from Instacart's previous scheme, which rewarded the best-rated workers with $100 for the week.</p>", "<p>Strikers have accused Instacart of retaliation. The company told NPR that the timing was coincidental and that the $3 quality bonus had been a test that did not meaningfully improve the quality of work.</p>", "<p>\"I could usually count on getting that bonus about 30% of my time. [That's] 10 orders a week, so now I'm $30 down,\" says Smith, who picked up Instacart as her primary income in August 2018 after her family struggled to run a toy store they'd opened in a Dallas suburb.</p>", "<p>In a matter of a year, Smith says, she has noticed Instacart's pay declining for each order: \"I was making the same amount of money in 40 hours that I'm making in 50 now,\" she says.

The decor is industrial chic \u2014 exposed ducts and poured concrete floors \u2014 and it's spacious enough to accommodate the enormous throngs of elated fans who crowded in after the Washington Nationals' recent World Series win.</p>", "<p>On a recent night, the bar was quieter. Still, customer after customer strode up to a stainless steel wall lined with beer taps to insert a card, touch a screen and pour a glass of self-serve beer.</p>", "<p>No waitstaff. No waiting.</p>", "<p>\"This is my first time doing a beer wall!\" says one patron, Chris Porcaro, over a yeasty IPA. \"I've been to many sports bars, but never a beer-wall sports bar.\"</p>", "<p>The shiny beer wall allows customers to choose from 23 different varieties of beer \u2014 or \"24 if you count Bud Light,\" says owner Jeremy Gifford. Pour-your-own beer isn't just a novelty, Gifford says; the idea is to cut down on waiting for alcohol (which means selling more of it) and freeing up bartenders to make cocktails.</p>", "<p>Laws regulating this technology vary from state to state. At Walters, the beer wall cuts customers off after they pour 32 ounces \u2014 the equivalent of 2 pints. For more, they must get approved by staff. (\"We make sure you still got your pants on and everyone's doing OK,\" Gifford says.)</p>", "<p>Pour-your-own technology has been featured in bars and restaurants for years, but its appeal has never been more obvious to owners staring at balance sheets that include astronomical rents in desirable locations and new mandatory minimum wage increases in 18 states this year.</p>", "<p>\"Labor is one of the largest costs in running a restaurant,\" Gifford says. \"As it should be, right? We are in the service business and there needs to be an interaction.\"</p>", "<p>Burly and bearded, Gifford is direct about his financial realities. His monthly rent at Walters costs him close to $30,000, he says. He employs about 24 people there. The beer wall set him back about $100,000, but he believes it will eventually pay for itself.</p>", "<p>\"If you have 50 self-serve taps, then you essentially have 50 employees you don't have to pay to service your customer,\" says Josh Goodman, who runs a company called PourMyBeer that sells this technology.</p>", "<p>According to Goodman and others in the industry, self-serve taps are exploding in popularity. Back in 2015, Goodman says, his company sold fewer than 200 taps. But over the past five years, it has sold more than 5,000, he says.</p>", "<p>Business doubled in 2017 at a similar company called iPourIt, says its vice president, Darren Nicholson. And last year, he says, it grew by a whopping 70%.</p>", "<p>\"When I entered the industry back in early 2016, there were probably only 80 locations in the U.S. [that sold self-serve beer],\" Nicholson says. \"There's currently about 400 in the U.S.\"</p>", "<p>That may not seem like a large number, he says, but it's a 400% increase. Plus, Nicholson says, the technology allows <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/tags/161337202/big-data\">Big Data</a> to pull up a bar stool.</p>", "<p>\"It's all anonymized,\" he says. \"But I can tell you, in a region, what 40-year-old-plus women prefer, just based on the demographics we collect from that region.\"</p>", "<p>PourMyBeer's electronic taps do the same thing, says Goodman: \"The big initiative now is to get them all communicating to one centralized mothership dataset, so then we're gathering really unique information about products being dispensed.\"</p>", "<p>It's not just beer. Self-serve wine bars are popping up around the country, observes Andrew Adams of the <em>Wine Analytics Report,</em> an industry monthly. He says that because staff needn't open just one bottle to serve a glass, the technology can reduce waste. And when it comes to cocktails, automated self-serve taps pour exactly the same drink every time.</p>", "<p>Goodman says PourMyBeer is working with Whole Foods, the U.S. military and even companies that do not serve alcohol at all. Cold-brew coffee and kombucha taps may be coming to companies such as Dunkin' and Starbucks. \"I guess anywhere you see a line, we see an opportunity,\" he says.</p>", "<p>At a similar company called Table Tap, business has shot up sixfold since 2016, according to founder Jeff Libby. He says he has installed self-serve taps not just at bars and restaurants, but in co-working spaces and apartment lobbies in a bid to appeal to millennials.</p>", "<p>But boomers have also been a surprisingly successful market, he says. \"Senior living communities love self-serve beer,\" he says, laughing. \"We put one in a senior living community and they are crushing it. They're having to cut people off!\"</p>", "<p>Doesn't cutting out servers, in the service industry, feel a little off? Libby concedes that many bartenders don't like self-serve beer. \"I know that for a fact,\" he says.</p>", "<p>But at Walters Sports Bar, I found a former bartender pouring himself a Death By Coconut, a porter from the specialty brewery Oskar Blues. \"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says John Murphy, of the self-serve technology. \"But I do love being able to just walk over and quench my thirst.\"</p>", "<p>Grinning, he added: \"And I'm always thirsty.\"</p>", "<p><em>Ted Robbins edited this story for broadcast.</em></p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Microsoft's cloud business Azure has been a distant second in size to AWS, which also previously won a cloud contract with the CIA. But a former Pentagon official familiar with the JEDI deal <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/05/776496195/amazon-expected-to-fight-pentagons-decision-on-microsoft-for-10-billion-contract\">previously told</a> NPR that Microsoft's bid \"hit the ball out of the park.\" </p>", "<p>A Microsoft representative did not immediately respond on Thursday. A Defense Department representative said: \"We will not speculate on potential litigation.\"</p>", "<p>At stake is a high-profile project to move the American military to the cloud. The winner of JEDI, in simplest terms, would become the single manager of the process. This company would unify the Pentagon's many disjointed networks and give U.S. war fighters access to cutting-edge computing technology like artificial intelligence anywhere in the world. </p>", "<p>When bidding on JEDI opened in 2018, Amazon was seen as the only company that already matched the qualifications. Rival Oracle led a cantankerous lobbying campaign that accused the Pentagon and Amazon of a cozy relationship, pointing to Defense Department employees who had done work for AWS.</p>", "<p>The Defense Department, the Government Accountability Office and the Court of Federal Claims reviewed the bidding and allowed it to proceed.
