The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 900 points, ending the week with a 17% loss.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The increasingly drastic measures in the U.S. came as gasping patients filled the wards of hospitals in Spain and Italy, and the global death toll surpassed 11,000, with the virus gaining footholds in new corners of the world. Over a quarter-million people worldwide have been infected, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University, though close to 90,000 of them have recovered.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe, reported 627 new deaths, its biggest day-to-day rise since the outbreak began, and said new cases also shot up. Italy now has seen over 4,000 deaths \u2014 more even than China \u2014 and 47,000 infections. The soaring numbers came despite a nationwide lockdown.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The World Health Organization highlighted the epidemic\u2019s dramatic speed, noting it took more than three months to reach the first 100,000 confirmed cases but only 12 days to reach the next 100,000. Among those infected was a member of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s staff. The White House said that staffer did not appear to have \u201cclose contact\u201d with either Pence or Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Across the U.S., where the number of infected topped 17,000, governors and public health officials watched the crisis in Europe with mounting alarm and warned of <a class=\"\" href=\"/4aac3a10664097f38633149367ac3928\"> critical shortages</a><!-- --> of ventilators, masks and other gear at home. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In New York City, health officials told medical providers to stop testing patients for the virus, except for people sick enough to require hospitalization, saying testing is exhausting supplies of protective equipment.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As promised earlier in the week, President Donald Trump officially invoked emergency wartime authority to try to speed production of such equipment.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Countries frantically prepared for a deluge of patients in the coming weeks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Britain, the government asked 65,000 retired nurses and doctors to return to work. A convention center and hotels in Madrid were being turned into field hospitals for nearly 10,000 patients. France\u2019s military worked to build a makeshift medical center in the hard-hit town of Mulhouse. The U.S. readied military hospitals for civilian use.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump also announced the closing of the Mexican border to most travel but not trade. That brings it in line with the restrictions on the Canadian border earlier this week.

In New York, people venturing outside will have to stay at least 6 feet apart. And while they will be free to get some exercise to keep their sanity, there will be no \u201cplaying basketball with five other people,\u201d Cuomo said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThese provisions will be enforced,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThese are not helpful hints.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Bergamo, the epicenter of the Italian outbreak, cemeteries were overwhelmed. Patients at the city\u2019s main hospital lined up in a narrow ward, struggling for breath as doctors and nurses moved swiftly from one beeping machine to the next. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWhen the virus arrived here, there was no containment, and it spread through the valleys very quickly. ... Some said it was the normal flu. We doctors knew it was not,\u201d said Dr. Luca Lorini, head of intensive care at the hospital, where nearly 500 beds were dedicated to people suffering severe symptoms. Eighty patients were in intensive care. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While the illness is mild in most people, the elderly are particularly susceptible to serious symptoms. Italy has the world\u2019s second-oldest population, and the vast majority of its dead \u2014 87% \u2014 were over 70.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Still, even younger people are at risk.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cYou\u2019re not invincible,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned them. He noted that many countries are reporting that people under 50 make up a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of patients needing to be hospitalized.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some of the only good news came from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began and where hospitals were struggling just weeks ago. For the second day in a row, no new infections were reported and only 39 cases were recorded nationwide, all brought from the outside, the government said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">With the crisis waning there, China has begun sending medical supplies to Europe.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The shutdown of whole swaths of the world economy took its toll, from millions of unsold flowers rotting in piles in Kenya to the slow emptying of the world\u2019s skies. Canada received 500,000 applications for unemployment benefits, versus 27,000 for the same week last year. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the U.S., lawmakers and the White House sought to put together a <a class=\"\" href=\"/a9e625157c3e715b2811438b494eacff\">$1 trillion economic rescue plan</a><!-- --> that would include the dispensing of relief checks of $1,200 for adults and $500 per child. The British government likewise unveiled a huge package under which the country for the time in its history would help pay the wages of those in the private sector.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Iran\u2019s official toll of more than 1,400 dead was rising quickly as well amid fears it is underreporting its cases. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As the virus strengthened its foothold in Africa, the continent\u2019s busiest airport, in Johannesburg, announced that foreigners will no longer be allowed to disembark. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press reporters around the world contributed to this report.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

A 52-year-old nurse on Thursday became the first medical professional in Spain to die of COVID-19.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Italy, where the number of virus-related deaths surpassed those in China, 2,900 health care providers have been infected, or 10% of the country\u2019s total. Italian broadcasters regularly feature exhausted doctors and nurses begging people to stay home and expressing a sense of abandonment over inadequate protective gear. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Dutch health minister collapsed from exhaustion in the midst of a parliamentary session on Wednesday. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe\u2019re clapping tonight out of respect and to say thank you to all the health care workers in the Netherlands who are protecting us against this horrible coronavirus,\u201d King Willem-Alexander said while observing the ritual Tuesday night with his family at Palace Huis ten Bosch in The Hague.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The word spread mostly through the WhatsApp messaging service.

People still crowd street markets picking through piles of fruit and vegetables. Cars and trucks continue to fill the streets and commuters throng subway trains, though the volume of traffic is noticeably lower.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and his government have said a shutdown of the country would disproportionately hurt poor people and also be a psychological weight on all Mexicans. They say there is no reason to impose major restrictions before health officials deem them necessary \u2014 a moment they are expecting in late March, based on the virus\u2019 pattern elsewhere and the Feb. 27 date of Mexico\u2019s first confirmed case. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The approach is worrying many experts.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But it is the president\u2019s personal attitude that has Mexicans puzzled. He continues to attend mass public rallies, shaking hands and kissing babies. Asked how he was protecting Mexico, L\u00f3pez Obrador removed two religious amulets from his wallet and proudly showed them off. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe protective shield is the \u2018Get thee behind me, Satan,\u2019\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said, reading off the inscription on the amulet, \u201cStop, enemy, for the Heart of Jesus is with me.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">L\u00f3pez Obrador, often described as a leftist, is in fact a nationalist with deep religious feelings.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think President L\u00f3pez Obrador is trying to project confidence and minimize the risk,\u201d said Jesus Silva-Herzog, a political commentator and professor at the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey University. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But, Silva-Herzog added, \u201cI think that what he has wound up doing is minimizing the risks associated with the emergency, and sending messages that contradict what is being said almost everywhere else.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Mexico reported its first death from the virus Wednesday and announced a second Friday. As of late Friday, the country had 203 confirmed cases of coronavirus, up from just over 40 a week ago.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Still, Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell, deputy secretary in the Health Ministry and the administration\u2019s public face of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s coronavirus response team, said the country remains in what it calls phase 1 of the epidemic, with all cases related to importation from other countries and no community transmission. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Federal officials have suspended classes for about a month beginning after Friday\u2019s school sessions and are encouraging things like social distancing, working from home and following hygienic measures recommended by international and domestic health experts. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some large events have been called off, yet others such as a multi-day music festival attended by tens of thousands in Mexico City were allowed to proceed. Federal officials recommend that \u201cnon-essential\u201d gatherings should not be larger than 5,000 people, while local authorities in the capital have said events topping 1,000 people should be canceled. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Mexico has only 5,000 emergency beds, and about 1,500 intensive care or sealed rooms, for a population of over 125 million, but officials still exude a sense of calm at their daily briefings on the virus. And some observers say they are chilled by remarks like L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think this has shown a lack of respect by the president,\u201d said Carlos Padilla, a Mexico City business administrator. \u201cI think he should be doing a better job of protecting the public, in every sense.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Once community transmission begins \u2014 and Mexican officials make no secret that they know it is coming, sooner rather than later \u2014 the country is likely to see more aggressive measures.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe are prepared.

The conservative National Action Party sent a letter to the Pan American Health Organization on Thursday expressing its \u201cdeep concern about the government\u2019s actions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Former diplomat Enrique Berruga Filloy said in a column for the newspaper El Universal on Thursday that Mexico\u2019s geographic advantages gave it more leeway to plan for the virus and take timely actions, but that the administration has squandered the chance. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe tsunami is coming and we, instead of seeking safety, are playing on the beach,\u201d Berruga Filloy wrote.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Like in other countries, Mexico\u2019s stock market has been hit hard by coronavirus concerns. The peso has slid precipitously, trading over 24 to the dollar at times this week for the first time in history. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Alfredo Couti\u00f1o of Moody\u2019s Analytics said Mexico\u2019s markets \u201care now realizing that the country is facing a higher risk of contamination by the coronavirus\u201d with the Mexican economy already weak.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Despite assurances from officials, Mexico and its health system are showing \u201creal vulnerability,\u201d Couti\u00f1o said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He said investors particularly don\u2019t like the lack of government measures to protect the economy and the people. \u201cFiscal and monetary policies are running far behind the curve,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">National Action senators proposed a package of measures this week that would include measures such as lowering interest rates, stimulating home construction and infrastructure, reactivating private investment in the energy sector and transferring money to the Health Department. But L\u00f3pez Obrador is known for a visceral dislike of spending and deficits.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">L\u00f3pez-Gatell displayed the administration\u2019s attitude Thursday when he said everything is going according to plan. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAll of the scenarios that we foresaw for what was going to happen, are happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will allow us to keep to a well-planned, well-calculated technical plan of action.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">L\u00f3pez Obrador, who enjoys approval ratings that would be the envy of many a world leader, said Thursday that military medical workers and installations would be part of the pandemic response. But he ruled out any curfew or troop deployments, saying he wanted nothing to do with tough measures that could be seen as authoritarian.</p>"]}

They flew 410 kilometers (255 miles) cross-country on an apogee of 50 kilometers (31 miles) before landing in waters off the eastern coast.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">South Korea and the U.S. were analyzing the launches. Seoul\u2019s military urged the North to immediately stop its \u201cvery inappropriate\u201d military demonstrations when the world is struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Japan\u2019s Defense Ministry said the projectiles didn\u2019t reach Japanese territory or its exclusive economic zone. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The North conducted two previous rounds of similar short-range launches and other military exercises this month after leader Kim Jong Un entered the new year vowing to bolster his nuclear deterrent in face of \u201cgangster-like\u201d U.S. sanctions and pressure. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While the North is clearly determined to advance its missile capabilities, Japan\u2019s Defense Minister Taro Kono said Pyongyang\u2019s demonstrations could also be aimed at \u201cbracing the regime together\u201d amid the coronavirus crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what North Korea tested. Flight data released by the South Korean and Japanese militaries suggest that the North could have tested one of its new mobile, solid-fuel missile systems it first demonstrated last year. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Military analysts say such weapons, which are designed to overwhelm missile defense systems with their maneuverability and low-altitude flights, potentially strengthen the North\u2019s ability to strike targets in South Korea and Japan, including U.S. bases there. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">North Korea in recent months has also demonstrated what it described as a \u201csuper large\u201d multiple rocket launcher, which experts say was likely tested earlier this month. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">North Korea\u2019s state media earlier reported that Kim supervised an artillery firing competition between army units in the country\u2019s west on Friday. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The KCNA said Kim expressed satisfaction over the exercise that was aimed at evaluating combat readiness.

It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what would be discussed. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nuclear talks have stalemated since the collapse of the second summit between Kim and President Donald Trump in early 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Following the breakdown in talks, the North ended a 17-month pause in ballistic activity and conducted at least 13 rounds of weapons launches last year while pressuring Washington and Seoul for concessions. Those weapons also included a developmental mid-range missile that could be launched from submarines.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some experts say the lull in North Korean launches between November and March could have been caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which started in mainland China in December. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Although Kim has vowed to build up his nuclear arsenal and achieve a \u201cfrontal breakthrough\u201d against sanctions while urging his nation to stay resilient in a struggle for economic \u201cself-reliance,\u201d some experts say North Korea\u2019s self-imposed lockdown amid the coronavirus crisis could potentially hamper his ability to mobilize people for labor. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">North Korea has not publicly confirmed a single case of the COVID-19 illness, but state media have described anti-virus efforts as a matter of \u201cnational existence.\u201d Experts say an epidemic in North Korea could have dire consequences due to the country\u2019s poor health system and shortage of medical supplies.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The country has banned foreign tourists, shut down nearly all cross-border traffic with China, intensified screening at entry points and mobilized health workers to monitor residents and isolate those with symptoms.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.</p>"]}

Thirteen others were sick but hadn\u2019t been tested, and one passenger was sent to a local hospital. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Harrell, 51, said she isolated two other passengers who were having breathing problems. One had a chronic lung disease and needed to be hooked to a ventilator, she said. Another passenger had an asthma attack and several others fainted, apparently from low blood sugar levels. Harrell said many travelers were coughing and she helped treat people who had a fever.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThere should have been medical personnel on that flight,\u201d Harrell said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Costa Luminosa passengers also complained they were given no food other than orange juice and crackers in more than 24 hours \u2014 the time it took to disembark in Marseille, France, to fly to Atlanta, and be cleared by officials.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At one point, Harrell said, the flight attendants handed her the cabin microphone. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI basically took over the plane,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even make this up for a movie.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In another instance, the co-pilot asked her and others whether they should land in Bermuda, instead of continuing all the way to Atlanta.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice. We had been turned away for the last eight days,\u201d Harrell said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For many, the flight was a culmination of an already harrowing journey that began on March 5 in Fort Lauderdale. Some passengers said they wanted to cancel the trans-Atlantic cruise, but the company refused to give them a refund, assuring them it was safe to go three days before the U.S. State Department issued a warning for U.S. citizens not to travel on cruise ships.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On March 8, an Italian woman disembarked in Puerto Rico with breathing problems. She and her husband, who also got off the boat, were hospitalized and tested positive for the new coronavirus.

The local administration for the Marseille region said in a statement that 36 people have tested positive for the new virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The screening process for the passengers who got on the flight to the U.S. isn\u2019t clear, but Harrell said many of the passengers were visibly sick when they boarded the jet.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThey just wanted us to get home so we could be taken care of here,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody, basically, on that flight had medical conditions.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">After the plane landed, Harrell called 911 because CDC officials wanted to start screening, but she demanded food first.

The ban would apply to people who cross for tourism or recreation and other activities deemed \u201cnon-essential.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cEveryone else is not expected to have any difficulties,\u201d Ebrard told reporters in Mexico City. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about closing it.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The ban, which takes effect at 11:59 p.m. Friday, does not include commercial traffic and remains in place as long as needed, officials said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">By excluding commercial traffic from the ban, the two governments substantially softened the economic effects. Also, fewer Americans are heading south because of a statewide stay-at-home order in California and a State Department warning advising Americans not to travel abroad.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Still, the restrictions are a major development along the world\u2019s most heavily crossed border. Mexican shoppers are the lifeblood of smaller U.S. border towns, and it is common for people in both countries to cross frequently to visit family and friends.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As news of the ban spread, people like 68-year-old El Paso resident Silvia Shadden rushed to cross even if her reason could meet the definition of essential. Walking with a crutch, she returned from getting a weekly vitamin injection from a doctor in Mexico\u2019s Ciudad Juarez that costs a fraction of what it does in the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI went to Juarez to see the doctor and get my injection,\u201d Shadden, who suffers from a vitamin deficiency that causes muscle atrophy, said as she returned from the U.S. border checkpoint.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In San Diego, an outlet mall catering to shoppers at the nation\u2019s busiest border crossing was closed and people made the last of what would be considered non-essential trips under the new rules. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Robert Booker, a lifelong San Diego resident, returned from a quick trip to his tailor in Tijuana before the shutdown. \u201cI wanted to make sure I have my clothes,\u201d he said with a laugh. Turning serious, he said he understood the rationale for the new restrictions.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe want the pandemic to be eradicated, so whatever it takes for the safety of all the people, that\u2019s what we have to do,\u201d Booker said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Christina Rodriguez, a college student from Washington state, returned from a visit with family in Mexico \u2014 a trip that wouldn\u2019t be allowed as of Saturday. \u201cEverything\u2019s up in the air,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are just trying to go where they need to be during the isolated time.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Acting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told reporters at the White House that the restrictions were aimed at eliminating non-essential travel while \u201cpreserving essential economic activity\u201d at the border. American citizens and permanent legal residents would still be allowed to return to the United States.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe want to make sure that cargo continues, trade continues, heath care workers continue to be able to traverse that border,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cBut tourism, some recreational activities and other things needs to stop during this crisis.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump said the border restrictions and the plan to immediately return anyone detained while illegally crossing are intended to curb the spread of the virus in detention facilities as well as a \u201cmass global migration that would badly deplete the health care resources needed for our people.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The measure to quickly turn back migrants would include those crossing illegally into the United States as well as into Canada, where some people have fled to escape U.S. enforcement efforts.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Ebrard, reacting to reports that the U.S. planned to send people from elsewhere into his country, including asylum seekers, said Mexico would only accept the return of migrants from his country and Central America.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump said Friday that the U.S. would send non-Mexicans \u201cback to their own countries, not to Mexico.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wolf said the U.S. would send people back to their homelands but was also \u201cworking with Mexico to send additional populations back there as well.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security did not address the apparent contradiction.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Trump also said that Mexico would suspend flights from Europe. Ebrard said his government had not yet made that decision. Mexico has reported just over 200 cases while the U.S. count has reached almost 11,000.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials say <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">a long list</a><!-- --> of \u201cessential\u201d workers would be unaffected going to and from their jobs, including farm workers, restaurant and grocery store employees and bus drivers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Keeping trade flowing, as the U.S. and Canada also agreed to do, contains the economic damage. Mexico is the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partner, just ahead of Canada. The U.S. accounts for about 75% of Mexican exports, including autos, computers and medical devices.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Even with the exceptions, it\u2019s a major blow to border economies. An average of 40,000 cars enter the U.S. daily from Tijuana, Mexico, at the busiest crossing in San Diego, which has a second crossing that funnels about 19,000 cars a day. About 30,000 cars enter El Paso daily from Ciudad Juarez. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The State Department on Thursday issued a new travel alert urging Americans not to go abroad under any circumstances and to return home if they are already abroad unless they plan to remain overseas.

There are also other smaller, more local outfits. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Sinaloa, long led by notorious kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who is serving a life sentence at a Colorado supermax, is based out of the Pacific coast state of the same name but has a presence in much of the country, sometimes via allied local proxies. Sinaloa survived an apparent power dispute after Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s extradition that ended with the capture of cartel figure D\u00e1maso L\u00f3pez in 2017 and the surrender of his son. Today Guzm\u00e1n associate Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada and Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons, known as \u201clos Chapitos\u201d or \u201cthe little Chapos,\u201d are believed to be firmly in control. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Jalisco, based in Guadalajara, Jalisco, is Mexico\u2019s fastest rising cartel, aggressively expansionist and not shying away from brazen, brutal tactics such as the October 2019 massacre of 13 police officers in Michoacan or the mass dumping in August of 19 bodies in the same state. CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d is one of the most wanted men by both Mexico and the United States; the latter has offered a $10 million reward for his capture. The DEA says Jalisco is present in at least 24 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">THE CONFLICTS</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">There are turf wars in many states, often between local groups or rival factions of erstwhile allies or even proxies for the big cartels. Jalisco\u2019s ambition to expand and subsume smaller groups all over the country is seen as driving much of the conflict. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Experts say Jalisco is fighting Sinaloa in places from Tijuana, across from San Diego; to Zacatecas, in central Mexico; to Quintana Roo, home to Cancun and other popular Caribbean resorts. It\u2019s fighting Gulf and Zetas splinters in Veracruz, along the Gulf of Mexico. And in states such as Guerrero and Michoacan, against local groups such as Los Viagras. Michoacan has seen some of the most shocking violence so far in 2020, such as the massacre in early February of nine people including four boys at a video arcade. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Sinaloa is also in conflict with Juarez remnants and proxies in the border area of the northern states of Chihuahua and Sonora; it was here that three women and six children from the U.S.-Mexican Mormon community were ambushed and shot dead in November along a rural mountain road. Sinaloa is also said to be supporting some local groups in their fights against Jalisco.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Zetas and Gulf offshoots are disputing control of the eastern part of Mexico\u2019s border with Texas, including the Gulf coast state of Tamaulipas, a key smuggling corridor. Scott Stewart, a vice president and security analyst for global intelligence firm Statfor, said Jalisco has also made a play there including in Reynosa, across from McAllen, Texas. He called the conflict in Reynosa \u201ca free-for-all\u201d with little likelihood of a single figure emerging to control the \u201cplaza\u201d anytime soon. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">THE DRUGS</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">The DEA says Mexican cartels continue to \u201cexport significant quantities of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl\u201d to U.S. markets. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">According to a February report by Stratfor, synthetics such as meth and fentanyl offer the largest profit margins. Production appears to be exceeding U.S. demand, it said, and cartels have begun looking to ship synthetics to new markets in places like Australia, New Zealand and Europe. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Precursor drugs are often imported from China. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Stratfor also noted an increase in 2019 in production of concentrated cannabis oil. Often smuggled in buckets, it\u2019s more compact and easier to move across the border than the huge marijuana bales of old and can be used to make edibles and other products. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Most cross-border drug smuggling happens through ports of entry in private vehicles or mixed in with legitimate cargo on tractor-trailer trucks, according to the DEA. Cartels, mostly Sinaloa, employ underground tunnels to California and Arizona. They also use cargo trains, passenger buses, boats and individuals carrying loads in backpacks. The DEA says cartels use light aircraft for drug drops, mostly marijuana. Drone use is currently limited to small loads, though that could change \u201cif their carrying capacity is increased.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">OTHER INTERESTS</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Cartels and gangs aren\u2019t just in the business of smuggling drugs and fighting each other. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Rather, they have diversified into a range of illegal activities such as extorting businesses \u2014 Coca-Cola Femsa was forced to shutter a bottling plant in Guerrero in 2018, and last year a Ford dealership in Guanajuato closed after it was shot up. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Criminal groups are also involved in kidnapping, people-smuggling and theft of cargo and fuel. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government has prioritized cracking down on fuel theft and says it has dramatically reduced incidence rates, but that has come with its own unwelcome side effects \u2014 in Guanajuato, the Santa Rosa gang has turned from fuel theft to extortion. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">A notable exception, according to security consultant Samuel Gonz\u00e1lez, who previously headed up the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s Office\u2019s now-defunct Special Organized Crime Unit, is the Sinaloa cartel, which he said has basically stuck to the traditional business of moving drugs: \u201cThey have not wanted to get involved in other areas.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">TACKLING THE GANGS?</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">L\u00f3pez Obrador espouses what he calls \u201chugs not bullets,\u201d emphasizing addressing root social causes of criminality such as poverty, inequality and joblessness. That\u2019s at least a rhetorical departure from his two immediate predecessors, the latter of whom launched Mexico\u2019s militarized anti-cartel offensive in 2006. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">L\u00f3pez has restructured security forces under a new National Guard, with tens of thousands of troops drawn mostly from police and the armed forces. But immediately upon deployment last year, many Guardsmen were diverted to immigration enforcement following pressure from Washington. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Last October saw a security operation in Culiacan, the cradle of the Sinaloa Cartel, that cornered one of \u201cEl Chapo\u2019s\u201d sons. After gunmen with high-caliber weapons paralyzed the city with gunbattles, blockades and burned vehicles, authorities ordered a retreat and the son was allowed to go free to prevent further loss of life. That decision prompted questions about whether the federal government has a realistic strategy to achieve security. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">L\u00f3pez Obrador, in office since December 2018, says it will take time for his holistic approach to bear fruit. He has also said that white-collar crime such as corruption has done more damage than the cartels. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Both gangland violence and corruption are problems that well precede his administration.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">Since then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched a militarized anti-cartel offensive in 2006, homicide rates are up more than triple. Mexico recorded 35,588 murders in 2019, the most since comparable records began to be kept in the 1990s, although the rate of increase was 2.7% \u2014 significantly below recent years. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-68 Component-p-0-2-60\">The rule of law is broadly wanting in Mexico \u2014 over 90% of all crimes go unpunished \u2014 and many areas lack firm regional control, either by government or a strong gang. </p>"]}

Then he enters a cramped clinic teeming with listless patients, many malnourished, some vomiting, others with diarrhea.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Al-Mansouri, a pediatrician, has been struggling for years to battle the rapid spread of otherwise preventable and treatable infections, such as cholera, that have surged in war-ravaged Yemen.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Now as the coronavirus outbreak intensifies in the region, he is faced with a new threat, one he can only hope to ward off with a handful of masks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI cannot even speak about our preparedness for the coronavirus,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we have none.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Long-running wars and conflicts across the Middle East have wrecked potential defenses against coronavirus outbreaks, leaving millions vulnerable in Yemen, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, the Gaza Strip and elsewhere. Health care systems have been gutted; war has blasted key infrastructure. Several of the countries are carved up among rival claimant governments, factions or armed groups, snarling any attempt at nationwide protection programs. Hundreds of thousands of people driven from their homes by fighting are crowded in close quarters in tent camps or improper housing.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe are becoming very worried,\u201d said John Nkengasong, director of Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as the virus reached conflict-ridden Iraq, Libya, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \u201cThe impact will be magnified.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Most patients who contract the new coronavirus develop only mild symptoms and recover after about two weeks. But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by those with no visible symptoms. For older adults and people with underlying health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">So far Yemen, Libya, Syria and Gaza have not confirmed any infections. But doctors in many cases believe the virus has arrived and fear that a lack of disease surveillance systems \u2014 shortages of tests, basic supplies and properly trained professionals \u2014 is allowing an invisible pandemic to spawn.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe don\u2019t have the testing capabilities, so we can only rely on symptoms and signs. But when I do see symptoms and try to report them, no one does anything. People go home, they go out, walk around, eat in restaurants,\u201d said Dr. Wejdan Sabri, an orthopedic doctor outside Libya\u2019s capital, Tripoli. \u201cI can say with certainty that those likely carrying the virus have continued their lives as normal, passing it to family members and others on the street.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Sabri is one of two volunteer doctors tasked with infectious disease control for the 2.3 million people in Tripoli, which has been a battleground for warring militias. She said she has seen at least seven patients in the last few days with the signature symptoms of coronavirus. She could only advise them to stay home or visit the central lab in Tripoli, where Libya\u2019s few dozen tests can be found. Many of her patients shun testing, fearing quarantine. \u201cThey think they\u2019ll go to an isolation unit and die.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Protective gear across Libya is sparse. A trauma doctor at Tripoli central hospital said 15 surgeons on his night shift share one mask. The main respiratory diseases facility in the east, near the city of Benghazi, has only eight intensive care beds, 10 ventilators and a quarantine room for two. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe are doing our best but of course it is not enough,\u201d said its director, Dr. Anas Albarghathy. Last weekend, doctors there found they didn\u2019t have the equipment to assemble tests for three patients who had just arrived from Iran, Egypt and Great Britain with fevers and dry cough.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Yemen, doctors fear that raging war and a humanitarian crisis will only exacerbate the difficulties of determining chains of infection and containing the virus. The country, divided between a rebel-held north and government-run south, has already struggled to stop repeated cholera outbreaks that have infected more than 2 million people and killed nearly 4,000 since 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Taiz, one of the country\u2019s largest cities, Dr. Abdul Rahman al-Azraqi estimated that 80% of the city\u2019s hospitals and clinics had been shattered by the war and ongoing siege. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He described the situation in his hospital bluntly: \u201cThere is no training. There is no quarantine. We do not have tests for patients we suspect.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The World Health Organization has identified two facilities in the country of 29 million people for quarantine and diagnosis, which local director Atlaff Musani acknowledged would soon become \u201cgrossly insufficient.\u201d One, in the rebel-held capital of Sanaa, has the capability to carry out only 200 tests; the other, in the southern city of Aden, can test roughly 300 specimens.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cPeople are scared because they know the government is not prepared,\u201d said Dr. Mohamed Rabid, deputy director of the Aden\u2019s health office, lamenting that hospitals across the country are desperate for gloves, goggles, ventilators, medicines and other supplies.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Concerns have compounded as the virus sweeps across poorly patrolled borders. Iran, which has emerged as the regional epicenter of the outbreak, frequently sends military advisers and Shiite religious pilgrims to Syria. All 21 confirmed cases in Afghanistan traveled from neighboring Iran. Oil workers circulate between Libya and Italy, a major center of contagion. Thousands of migrants cross Libya\u2019s southern frontier, which Elizabeth Hoff, the country\u2019s World Health Organization representative, called \u201ca serious vulnerability that we can\u2019t really do anything about.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the Gaza Strip, medical infrastructure has been strangled by mismanagement by the Islamic militant Hamas rulers and a 13-year blockade imposed by Israel with Egypt\u2019s help that has complicated the passage of key medical equipment and supplies. While Israel has closed its border crossing, it continues to allow serious medical cases through. Gaza\u2019s testing capacity remains severely limited, with enough to process 150 samples. Israel has delivered an additional 200 tests. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Wednesday, Israeli officials said they have coordinated the delivery of hundreds of additional test kits, along with medical protection equipment, from the World Health Organization. Israeli officials say they are closely monitoring the situation in Gaza and ready to work with the international community if there is a widespread outbreak.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Syria, where nine years of devastating war have left infrastructure and health facilities in shambles, President Bashar Assad\u2019s government has conducted 103 coronavirus tests thus far in the country\u2019s sole laboratory, which came back negative. Social distancing proves a monumental task in unsanitary refugee camps jam-packed with hundreds of thousands of displaced Syrians.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Afghanistan, which shares a large border with Iran, Health Minister Ferozuddin Feroz described a growing capacity to test suspected cases at the country\u2019s only functioning laboratory, with 30,000 more kits arriving soon. \u201cWe are not in a normal situation,\u201d Faroz told reporters Monday. \u201cWe are faced with a national threat.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Gaza and Benghazi, authorities scrambled to set up new hospitals to handle a possible influx of patients. In Tripoli, Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj announced the allocation of some $360 million to prevent the spread of the virus. Dr. Sabri, the Libyan orthopedic, says she won\u2019t get a full night\u2019s sleep for a while as she stages awareness campaigns and frantically trains inexperienced nurses in basic sanitation.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Officials in Yemen and Libya offered reassurances this week that things were under control. But not everyone sees it that way.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cPeople are terrified,\u201d said al-Mansouri, the Yemeni pediatrician. \u201cMay God protect us.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">____</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writers Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip; Zeina Karam in Beirut; and Rahim Faiez in Kabul, Afghanistan contributed to this report.</p>"]}

The move underscored the growing mutual mistrust and hostility between the world\u2019s two largest economies.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Since the virus has spread, President Donald Trump and his top aides, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have increasingly criticized China, noting consistently that the outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. They have also <a class=\"\" href=\"/5866bf32d5723402d2df32baa844fff3\">referred to the virus as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d</a><!-- --> or the \u201cChinese virus,\u201d disregarding World Health Organization terminology that avoids identifying it by geography.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On Wednesday, Trump again defended linking the virus to China just hours after repeatedly calling the virus the \u201cChinese Virus\u201d on Twitter.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s not racist at all. No, not at all. It comes from China,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At a State Department news conference on Tuesday, Pompeo called the virus the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d six times and suggested the Chinese are attempting to distract the world from the shortcomings of its initial response by highlighting its tough measures that have helped contain the outbreak. Pompeo also suggested that an \u201cafter action\u201d report would corroborate his claim, indicating that the tensions are unlikely to end when the pandemic is over. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Experts are not unsympathetic to that position.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThey made some blunderous mistakes in the early six or seven weeks, and then they came down hard with a gargantuan quarantine,\u201d said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, referring to China. Now, he said in a conference call with reporters, China is suppressing \u201cwhatever additional dissident thoughts there may be on exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a meeting Tuesday with hotel executives at the White House, Trump took pains to make clear that the virus originated in China, asking pointed questions of Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson about where the impact was first felt.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAnd this all started in China? That\u2019s where you first saw the problem and where you first got hit?\u201d Trump asked.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sorenson replied. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cHopefully, you all heard that,\u201d Trump told reporters.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Pompeo has led <a class=\"\" href=\"/aa77ed1114ed45eb810ab67f4e84c1bb\">a worldwide campaign</a><!-- --> to try to stop countries from allowing the Chinese high-tech giant Huawei to get access to next-generation wireless networks and repeatedly warned about the dangers of Chinese investment. On Tuesday, he suggested China had failed to alert the world quickly enough when it discovered the virus outbreak.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe know that the first government to be aware of the Wuhan virus was the Chinese government,\u201d Pompeo told reporters. \u201cThat imposes a special responsibility, to raise the flag to say: \u2018We have a problem, this is different and unique and present risks.\u2019 And it took an awful long time for the world to become aware of this risk, that was sitting there, residing inside of China.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Having already been targeted by Trump in a trade war and by Pompeo and others for repression of Muslim and other religious and ethnic minorities in <a class=\"\" href=\"/c1d08873154907be8a3dd93562d6785c\">western Xinjiang Province</a><!-- -->, the Chinese have taken particular offense to the constant linking of the virus to China, complaining vociferously and suggesting that the U.S. military may have actually introduced the virus to Wuhan.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cRecently, some American politicians have linked the new coronavirus with China to stigmatize China.

And rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it\u2019s a very accurate term. But no, I didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Shortly after Trump\u2019s comments, the Chinese foreign ministry announced the expulsion of American reporters from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post.

The plan was in the works since late last year, a senior coalition military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe withdrawal was agreed between the Iraqi government and the coalition forces,\u201d said Brig. Tahseen al-Khafaji, who was at a withdrawal ceremony.

Three separate attacks in the span of a week struck Camp Taji and Basmaya bases, killing three coalition servicemen including two Americans. The coalition official said the attacks, believed to be carried out by Iran-backed militia groups, did not factor into the decision to pull out. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Iraq\u2019s military has also paused training activities with the coalition because of concerns about the coronavirus, the coalition official said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Iraq is taking measures to contain the spread of the virus by prohibiting large public gatherings, implementing a curfew in the capital and suspending airline flights.

Training stopped because of the \u201chealth risks associated with it,\u201d the official said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The decision to reduce the coalition\u2019s footprint in Iraq was conceived in December, the coalition official said, before U.S.-Iraq tensions soared following the Jan. 3 Washington-directed strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani outside Baghdad airport and prompted lawmakers to approve a nonbinding resolution that U.S. troops should leave the country. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fraught political relations led to a pause in joint operations between the coalition and Iraqi security forces. At that time, the senior coalition official said, Iraq showed it was capable of preventing an IS resurgence by conducting operations alone and delivering training. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That affirmed plans from December to reduce the coalition presence across Iraq and limit assistance to high-level capabilities that Iraqi security forces lack, such as surveillance and air support, the coalition official said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe bottom line is we are going to focus our efforts on supporting the Iraqi security forces and their efforts against Daesh from fewer bases with fewer people,\u201d the official said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe are not saying that Daesh is finished.

East Asia\u2019s experience with the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which also originated in China, has likewise helped. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Since testing rates vary widely, it\u2019s hard to know for sure. But with the global number of infections surpassing 210,000, Singapore appears to be among the handful of places that tick all those boxes, though recent spikes in new cases show that any lapses can have dire consequences.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Singapore\u2019s first case, confirmed on Jan. 23, was a 66-year-old man from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the disease was first detected in December. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">By mid-February, the number of recovered patients in the Southeast Asian city-state was outpacing new ones. That changed in early March after 47 cases were tracked to a Feb. 15 dinner gathering. As of late Wednesday, Singapore had 313 confirmed cases and no deaths from the virus. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As new infections increased, the government tightened quarantine controls. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Taiwan, a self-governed island off the coast of mainland China, has confirmed just 100 cases and one death. Most recent cases were residents returning from overseas travel. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hong Kong has reported 167 cases and four deaths. Its leader, Carrie Lam, on Tuesday warned against all outbound travel and said any people arriving from outside greater China will face 14-day home quarantines or medical surveillance. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Of the 13 cases found in the tiny gambling enclave of Macao, 10 have recovered. Casinos have been closed for weeks to battle the outbreak. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Cambodia, which has confirmed three dozen cases, last weekend moved to stop foreigners traveling from France, the U.S., Spain, Germany, Italy and Iran after several new cases were found among travelers. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Thailand, likewise, appears to have kept cases under control with aggressive public health campaigns intended to minimize infections, though new cases jumped recently as stepped-up testing found clusters linked to a boxing tournament and an evening gathering at a bar. So far, 212 cases have been confirmed among 70 million Thais, even though it\u2019s a top destination for travelers, especially from China. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The virus that causes COVID-19 gives most people only mild symptoms but can also cause severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people who get it survive. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Assuming the numbers reported to the World Health Organization are accurate, many of the countries with lower caseloads are relatively isolated geographically: Singapore, New Zealand, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia. Some others may be latecomers in testing and reporting: Russia, Indonesia, Vietnam.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the experience of battling the 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected some 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, helped ensure residents took the risks seriously, experts say. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAlmost everyone played ball and followed accordingly,\u201d said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Singapore\u2019s Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. \u201cSARS was our baptism by fire and we were forced to learn everything by swimming in the deep end of the pool.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">After the SARS outbreak, when 238 people were infected and 33 died in Singapore, the city revamped its already excellent health care system, writing up new protocols for containing outbreaks. It set up \u201cfever centers\u201d to isolate suspected cases, invested in equipment and improved training in handling infectious diseases, Leong said. So when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered, Singapore was ready to act, he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">From Feb. 1, Singapore blocked entry and transit for new visitors who had traveled to mainland China within 14 days. These restrictions have since expanded to include visitors with recent travel to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">When the number of local cases without links to previous cases or travel in China surged, the government raised its alert to \u201corange,\u201d the second-highest level, on Feb. 7. The Singapore Air Show, a huge event that draws thousands, scaled back the number of participants and barred most exhibitors and visitors from China from attending. Good hygiene and avoiding handshakes were recommended. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The National Public Health Laboratory, set up after SARS, was prepared to fast-track testing, using advanced diagnostics and newly developed COVID-19 test kits. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Rapid testing and isolation of suspected cases, and painstaking tracing of contacts, helped by police, surveillance videos and ATM records, have helped prevent a worse local outbreak, said Tikki Pangestu, a visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former director of WHO\u2019s research policy and cooperation department.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Once a COVID-19 case is confirmed, Singapore embarks on \u201cdiligent contract tracing,\u201d said Pangestu. It ordered workers arriving from countries with endemic virus infections to stay home. Worship services were suspended in favor of livestreaming after a cluster was found at a church. Schools suspended mass assemblies and staggered recess. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">So far, 5,700 people have been quarantined. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Thailand, too, public health workers have gone door-to-door to track down contacts, said Thanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Disease Control Department of the Health Ministry. \u201cWe must go see them ourselves. This is an old public health way. We do our best,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It has mostly worked.

{"title": "Israelis accuse Netanyahu of exploiting virus to keep power", "articleDate": "March 20, 2020 GMT", "contributors": "By JOSEF FEDERMAN", "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israel appeared to be barreling toward a constitutional crisis Thursday as opponents took to the streets and turned to the Supreme Court to fight a series of unprecedented steps taken by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while confronting the coronavirus pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In recent days, Netanyahu and his surrogates have shut down the court system, approved the use of sophisticated phone-surveillance technology on the general public and temporarily suspended the activities of parliament. While Netanyahu has defended the moves as extraordinary steps in extraordinary times, his opponents accuse him of undermining Israel\u2019s democratic foundations in a desperate bid to cement his grip on power and derail a looming criminal trial after coming up short in parliamentary elections this month.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe state of Israel must do two very important things right now: Deal with the coronavirus crisis from its health, economic and social perspective and at the same time preserve Israeli democracy,\u201d Benny Gantz, his opponent and leader of the Blue and White Party, told Israeli Channel 12 TV. \u201cWe need to be very careful not to even approach the margins of dictatorship.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In this month\u2019s election, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party emerged as the largest single party in the Knesset, or parliament. But with his smaller religious and nationalist parties, he controls only 58 seats, three short of a majority required to form a government. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Gantz has the backing of 61 lawmakers, and under Israeli custom, was tapped this week by the country\u2019s president to try to form a new government. The former military chief has one month to complete the task. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the meantime, he is eager to push through a series of bills that could end Netanyahu\u2019s career by imposing term limits and banning an indicted politician from serving as prime minister.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The coronavirus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 220,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 10,000. For most people, it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Israeli health officials have diagnosed nearly 700 coronavirus cases, with a sharp spike in the past two days.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The crisis has given Netanyahu the opportunity to flaunt his legendary leadership skills and, critics say, to thwart Gantz from moving forward with his agenda. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Nearly every evening, Netanyahu gives a televised address, sternly telling the nation that he is imposing tough new restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus. He has ordered people to stay indoors, ordered tens of thousands of people into home quarantine and virtually sealed its borders.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Thursday\u2019s address, he said he was further tightening restrictions on movement, with exceptions only to go out for food or other urgent matters. \u201cYou must stay home. It\u2019s no longer a request,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">While other countries have taken similar steps, some of his decisions have been unprecedented. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Citing the coronavirus crisis, his hand-picked justice minister all but closed the court system in a middle-of-the-night order just two days before Netanyahu\u2019s trial on corruption charges was to begin.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In another overnight move, Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet authorized the Shin Bet security agency to use phone-tracking technology to retrace the movements of infected people and identify those who had come into contact with them. The technology had previously only been used as a surveillance tool against Palestinian targets. The decision was blasted by opposition politicians and civil rights groups as a violation of privacy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Then, on Wednesday, Parliament Speaker Yuli Edelstein abruptly suspended activities at the Knesset, preventing Gantz\u2019s allies from forming key committees to press ahead with their legislative agenda. Edelstein cited procedural issues, but critics accused him of working on behalf of Netanyahu. Edelstein has rejected the charges and vowed to reconvene the Knesset on Monday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dan Meridor, a former justice minister and one-time member of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet, said that Netanyahu\u2019s recent decisions were not \u201cwell considered.\u201d He said even if such steps are justifiable responses to the coronavirus, the decision making was flawed because the government\u2019s traditional checks and balances, such as parliamentary oversight and an active court system, were not functioning.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cEven in a time of crisis, one should not lose the basic structure of the government,\u201d Meridor said. \u201cHe still has to remember that he\u2019s not a ruler of a country.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Israel does not have a formal constitution, but instead has a series of \u201cBasic Laws\u201d that serve as a de facto constitution.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Meridor said the situation had not yet reached a crisis stage, but said a huge test would be whether Edelstein keeps his word to reconvene the Knesset on Monday. If he finds new excuses to prevent it from functioning, \u201cthen we are in deep crisis,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Edelstein rejected the public uproar and said he was committed to reconvening parliament. \u201cThe Knesset isn\u2019t closed. Democracy isn\u2019t in danger,\u201d he told Channel 12 TV.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Earlier Thursday, hundreds of people gathered outside the Knesset, defying government restrictions on large gatherings to protest the shutdown. Some held signs that said \u201cNo to dictatorship,\u201d \u201cDemocracy in danger\u201d and calling Netanyahu the \u201ccrime minister.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Police arrested three people for violating a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people. They also blocked a convoy of dozens of cars from entering Jerusalem to protest, and dozens of other motorists inside Jerusalem from approaching the Knesset building. Many cars honked and hung black flags out their windows.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe need to remember the foundation upon which this country was built,\u201d said protester Michal Levi. \u201cWe have only one country. That\u2019s it. Don\u2019t give up on it.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At the nearby Supreme Court, civil rights groups filed a challenge to the new phone-tracking tactics, claiming they amounted to an illegal violation of privacy. In a victory for the civil rights groups, the court ordered parliament to appoint its relevant oversight committees by Tuesday. Otherwise, the government will have to stop the phone surveillance.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hovering over all of the developments have been Netanyahu\u2019s legal troubles. He has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals in which he is accused of accepting expensive gifts and offering favors to media moguls in exchange for positive press coverage. Netanyahu denies the charges.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Netanyahu is desperate to stay in office throughout his trial, using his position to rail against what he sees as hostile police, prosecutors and media.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Israel Democracy Institute, an independent think tank that conducts research and gives advice to the government, issued a letter urging Edelstein to convene parliament immediately.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Yochanan Plesner, the institute\u2019s president, said Netanyahu appeared to be using stalling tactics to narrow Gantz\u2019s limited one-month window to push ahead the anti-Netanyahu legislation.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a struggle over the democracy, although it has democratic implications. It\u2019s a struggle over time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to erode the period of Gantz, his mandate and to ensure that he doesn\u2019t gain control over the Knesset and promote unfavorable legislation.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg and Alon Bernstein contributed.</p>"]}

Lagarde said in an op-ed article to appear in European newspapers Friday that \u201cwe are fully prepared to increase the size of our asset purchase programs and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed.\u201d She said the monetary authority for the 19 countries in the euro currency would \u201cdo everything necessary within our mandate to help the euro area through this crisis.\u201d Lagarde\u2019s words recalled the statement by predecessor Mario Draghi that \u201cwithin our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes\u201d to ensure the euro survived its 2010-2012 debt crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Bank of England on Thursday <a class=\"\" href=\"/678e7a33fdd4d5d8091773fac1b62d7d\">slashed </a><!-- --> its key interest rate to 0.1%, its lowest-ever level, amid global economic turmoil sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">AIRLINES: U.S. airlines are still lobbying for taxpayer cash to keep flying through the virus outbreak, despite failing to win White House support for $29 billion in grants. Thirty airline-industry groups appealed Thursday to congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for immediate and long-term help from the federal government.

The survival of our industry depends on it.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">President Donald Trump has said repeatedly that his administration will help the airlines. But while his administration is supporting $50 billion in secured loans, it did not endorse the grants or billions more in tax relief requested by the airlines. Consumer advocates and many Democrats in Congress want to tie any help for the airlines to specific measures including aid for workers, limits on ticket-change fees, and a ban on stock buybacks.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">American Airlines says it plans to cancel 55,000 flights next month and it is grounding nearly half the fleet while expecting plummeting demand for air travel to get even worse. The airline\u2019s president, Robert Isom, detailed the moves in a letter Thursday to employees.

Domino\u2019s put out the call for delivery drivers, pizza makers, managers and truck drivers. Domino\u2019s U.S. stores remain open for carryout and it is also offering contact-less delivery. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">DISLODGED: The hotel industry is being decimated as businesses cease travel and one-time tourists take shelter.

J.W. Marriott Jr., who serves as chairman, earned $3.2 million in 2018. CEO Arne Sorenson had a base salary of $1.3 million. The pay of other executives will be halved. Marriott occupancy in the U.S. and Europe is less than 25% \u2014 down from a usual rate of nearly 70%. Sorenson said cancellations have reached historic highs.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Greece ordered most hotels to shut down by Sunday and remain closed through all of April. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">FACTORED OUT: More companies are closing factory gates a day after the top U.S. automakers announced a total production shutdown in North America.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc. is indefinitely suspending production at its assembly plant in Fremont, California, at the end of the day Monday. The company says it followed federal guidelines in staying open even though seven Bay Area counties have ordered residents to shelter in place. Alameda County on Tuesday night declared Tesla a \u201cnonessential business\u201d under the county\u2019s shelter-in-place order, but the Fremont factory kept producing. On Thursday, Tesla said it would shut down except for basic operations. The company said its solar factory in New York also will temporarily suspend production, but its battery plant in Nevada and other operations will continue. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Subaru is temporarily closing its only U.S. factory out of concerns for worker safety due to the coronavirus, as well as to adjust for falling sales. The Japanese automaker says the plant in Lafayette, Indiana, will shut down on Monday and remain closed for at least a week. All workers will be paid for the week. The plant has about 5,700 workers.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kia and Volkswagen also said they would suspend production at their U.S. factories. The 2,700-worker Kia plant in West Point, Georgia will be closed Thursday and Friday due to a parts shortage. It will be cleaned and is expected to reopen Monday. Worker pay is being discussed. Volkswagen will halt assembly lines for a week starting Saturday at its Chattanooga, Tennessee, plant that employs 3,800. It\u2019s scheduled to reopen the night of March 29. VW says it will use the time to clean the plant and assess future production. Workers will get full pay, VW says. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Toyota also announced Thursday it will extend the closure of its North American plants until April 6. The plants will close Monday and Tuesday and had been scheduled to reopen Wednesday.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">They join General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Nissan and Hyundai in suspending production at North American factories. Auto factories run by BMW and Mercedes-Benz are still running.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hyundai said Thursday that it would close its plant in the Czech Republic for two weeks starting Monday. The plant produced almost 310,000 cars last year and employs some 3,300 people. Auto factories have been closed across much of Europe already. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">MANUFACTURING\u2019S SECOND ACT: Germany-based Beiersdorf, whose brands include Nivea and Coppertone, says it is launching production of medical disinfectant in Europe to support the fight against the virus. Beiersdorf said Thursday that it initially will provide 500 tons of disinfectant for hospitals, medical staff and emergency responders such as police and firefighters. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">CRUCIAL SUPPLY: Supermarkets have become one of the few places where social distancing rules are stretched. Brands like Campbell, which have struggled as more people seek out non-processed foods or those they believe are more fresh, have seen their stock spike. Placer.ai, a data analytics firm, said traffic at Kroger and Albertsons stores rose more than 35% the second week in March. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">British supermarkets have brought in measures to control the coronavirus-induced panic-buying that\u2019s seen many of their shelves emptied and elderly and vulnerable people often unable to get the products they need.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Established companies like Campbell and Hormel are not the only ones seeing demand surge. Blue Apron, which makes fresh meal kits for dinner preparation at home, was threatened with delisting from the New York Stock Exchange not so long ago after its shares fell below the exchange minimum $1. Company shares are up almost 530% this week. Blue Apron said it has seen a sharp increase in consumer demand over the last week and is increasing its capacity to fill those orders. It said it\u2019s hiring workers for temporary and permanent positions in New Jersey and California.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1240486275892662273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Follow AP coverage of the virus </a><!-- --> outbreak at <a class=\"\" href=\"/VirusOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</a><!-- --> and <a class=\"\" href=\"/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</a></p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

India\u2019s top court upheld the verdicts in 2017, finding the men\u2019s crimes had created a \u201ctsunami of shock\u201d among Indians.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe four convicts were hanged together at 5.30 a.m.,\u201d said Sandeep Goel, head of the Tihar Jail in New Delhi.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The victim, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, was heading home with a male friend from a movie theater when six men tricked into getting on a private bus. With no one else in sight, they beat her friend and repeatedly raped the woman. They penetrated her with a metal rod, causing fatal internal injuries. They dumped both victims on the roadside, and the woman died two weeks later.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Asha Devi, the mother of the victim, thanked the judiciary and government after the convicts were hanged.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cToday, we got justice and this day is dedicated to the daughters of the country,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI could not protect her but I was able to fight for her.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Devi said she hoped that courts in India will end delays in rape cases and punish convicts within a year\u2019s time.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\"> The case drew international attention at the time and prompted Indian lawmakers to stiffen penalties for rape, part of a wave of changes as India confronted its appalling treatment of women.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Facing public protests and political pressure after the attack, the government reformed some of India\u2019s antiquated laws on sexual violence and created fast-track courts for handling rape trials that formerly could last more than a decade.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The new laws prescribed harsher punishments for rapists and addressed new crimes, including acid throwing and stalking.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Friday that justice had prevailed and it was of utmost importance to ensure the dignity and safety of women.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cTogether, we have to build a nation where the focus is on women empowerment, where there is emphasis on equality and opportunity,\u201d he said on his Twitter account.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Hundreds of police were deployed outside the jail to control a crowd that waited to celebrate the executions.

There were no flowers, no embraces. Francesca Steffanoni and her mother hurried away from Bergamo\u2019s main cemetery, their furtive farewell lasting no more than 5 minutes. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Bergamo is the epicenter of the hardest-hit province of Italy\u2019s hardest-hit region, Lombardy, the site of hundreds of coronavirus deaths. Families here are deprived of a bedside farewell with virus-stricken loved ones, or even a traditional funeral, and the cemetery is so overwhelmed by the number of dead that military trucks transported 65 bodies to a neighboring region for cremation this week. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Steffanoni had taken her mother to watch as the coffin containing an 82-year-old relative \u2014 a widower with a heart condition, struck down with the virus \u2014 was driven inside the imposing gates. They wore masks and gloves; they kept their distance. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIn theory, we should not have gone. But it was one of her last relatives who remains,\u201d Steffanoni said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">According to unofficial figures, more than 600 people infected with the virus have died in the province, which is tucked up against the Italian Alps and accounts for more than a quarter of all deaths in Lombardy, even though it represents only a tenth of the region\u2019s population of 10 million.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe are confronting the biggest COVID emergency after Wuhan,\u201d said Dr. Luca Lorini, head of intensive care at Bergamo\u2019s main hospital, named for native son Pope John XXIII, where nearly 500 beds are dedicated to people suffering severe symptoms of the virus, 80 of those in intensive care. \u201cThe numbers tell us this.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But the numbers thus far don\u2019t tell the whole story. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Provincial mayors are sounding an alarm that the virus-related toll fails to reflect a spike in deaths in the general population among those who have not been tested. Last week alone, 400 people died in Bergamo and 12 neighboring towns \u2014 four times the number who died the same week the previous year, according to the Bergamo mayor\u2019s office. Only 91 of those had tested positive for the virus. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">People on the front lines of the virus fight, including hospital officials, funeral operators, city administrators and union leaders, told The Associated Press that Bergamo\u2019s crisis might have been prevented had their individual requests to create a red zone around the area as early as Feb. 23 been heeded. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Instead, strict containment measures were extended to Bergamo only on March 8, two weeks later, without ever isolating two valley towns where the outbreak was first recorded.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWhen the virus arrived here, there was no containment and it spread through the valleys very quickly. ... Some said it was the normal flu. We doctors knew it was not,\u201d Lorini said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Funeral parlors already were registering an alarming increase in deaths starting in January and February, an anomaly they signaled to officials, said Antonio Ricciardi, head of a local funeral parlor association. His business handled 611 funerals from March 1-18, when the usual pace is just over 100 in a full month. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">After the first death in nearby Alzano Lombardo was recorded and other cases confirmed on Feb. 23, doctors at the Pope John XXIII Hospital set up an emergency ICU to handle virus patients. That was two days after the lockdown of 10 towns in southern Lombardy, which has been largely declared a success and served as a model for the nationwide shutdown instituted March 9. </p>", "<p class=\"social-caption Component-root-0-2-85 Component-caption-0-2-82\">\"I cry inside\" ICU director at the heart of Italy's deadly virus crisis</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">No official explanation has been given for the decision not to extend red-zone status to Bergamo. Regional welfare official Giulio Gallera acknowledged the question but said he didn\u2019t want to place blame, adding \u201cwe are in a situation in which the entire region has substantially adopted particularly rigid measures.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Eliana Como of the influential FIOM metalworkers union said she believes the area\u2019s economic significance played a role in the decision not to place a red zone around towns at the mouth of the Seriana Valley, home to steel production and artisanal workshops. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think the business interests weighed heavily on the decision,\u201d said Como, who lives in Bergamo. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the epidemic\u2019s fourth week, Lorini estimates that the true number of infected in the area is 5 to 10 times the official figure of 4,645. The current regimen allows testing only of people who show up at a screening area at the hospital with severe symptoms, missing people who are sick at home.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe believe the true numbers (of COVID-19-related deaths) are hidden,\u201d said Francesco Alleva, spokesman for Bergamo\u2019s mayor. \u201cBecause many people are dying at home or in structures for the elderly, and they have never been tested for the virus.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">That uncertain toll is at the heart of officials\u2019 constant appeals for people to stay home. Police cars circulate Bergamo with loudspeakers instructing people not to go out except for true necessities, such as work or grocery shopping. To further discourage people from leaving their homes, Mayor Giorgio Gori this week turned off the public wi-fi and closed down gambling machines in tobacco shops, which remain open and where people can also pay some bills. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Though the increase in positive diagnoses has narrowed from some 500 a day this past weekend to over 300 on Thursday, Lorini said it would take until at least next week to determine if the containment measures were having an impact. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The inability to comfort virus-stricken family members in the hospital or even attend a funeral has been among the most wrenching aspects of the still-unfolding emergency. Hospital wards try to help by phoning updates to loved ones and allowing phone calls when patients start to recover. But when death is near, Lorini said, a visit would be \u201ca useless explosion of contagion.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt is terrible to lose a loved one and not be able to hug them. But that is what has happened in epidemics for a thousand years, and what will also happen for the next thousand years,\u201d Lorini said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Once a loved one with the virus dies, family members are not permitted to choose a favorite outfit for burial. By government decree, the dead are buried in the clothes they died in, wrapped in sterile blankets and placed inside coffins as quickly as possible. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThere is a huge psychological issue for family members who cannot see the body,\u201d Ricciardi said. \u201cWithout a body, it is hard to realize a death occurred.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The sobering toll hits in full force with just a glance at the local newspaper, L\u2019Eco di Bergamo, which has seen the number of pages dedicated to death notices multiply from one to nine, 10, even 11 pages. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a notice in Wednesday\u2019s edition, the family members of Bruno Maffeis, who died at age 66, expressed a \u201cheartfelt thank you to the doctors and personnel of Pope John Hospital in Bergamo, and in particular to Dr. Carlo Fino for his generous availability.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAs specified by the government, the funeral will be celebrated at a future date to be decided,\u201d the notice said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">____</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Barry reported from Soave, Italy. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

An actor, a major-general, a politician, a boxing trainer and a slew of ordinary fans are among the coronavirus cases from the March 6 event. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It\u2019s feared hundreds more in all corners of the country could be viral time bombs. Health officials take the threat seriously.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe more people who report themselves, the easier it is for us to track down others with the virus before it\u2019s too late.\u201d said Dr. Thaveesin Visanuyothin, a spokesman for the Public Health Ministry.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But even as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha this past week announced measures to fight the spread of COVID-19 \u2014 including postponing a major three-day holiday, shutting down schools and allowing provincial governors to close any gathering spaces \u2014 he insisted the country was not going into shutdown. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He told his countrymen the crisis had not yet reached Phase 3, an epidemic involving significant domestic transmission of the virus that would trigger more radical restrictions. How and when that would be determined is hard to judge, especially because Prayuth\u2019s government has been criticized for a lack of transparency and consistency in releasing information.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Even a crackdown implemented this week on arrivals sends a mixed message. Instead of banning international flights, as several nations have done, foreign visitors must have health certificates affirming they are free of the virus. The requirement is impractical, because in many if not most countries, it\u2019s hard to even get tested without showing symptoms of the illness. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Any illusion that Thailand would somehow avoid a spike in infections was dispelled this month with the discovery of a cluster case from a single discrete source. The infected people were a group of millennials who were reported to have been partying at an upmarket Bangkok nightspot with a visitor from Hong Kong. Health authorities scolded the partygoers for sharing drinks and cigarettes. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Just days later, a local celebrity in Muay Thai circles posted a message on his Instagram account. Muay Thai is the national sport, with a devoted fan base nationwide spanning social classes.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis is NOT a joke, for those that have been in close contact with me the last few days please take precautions. I have the Covid-19 virus#covid 19,\u201d said the March 13 message from Matthew Deane Chanthavanij, next to a video of him wearing a black surgical mask. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some people initially derided his post as a publicity stunt, bogus information for which he could be criminally prosecuted. In fact, it exposed a second, potentially more dangerous cluster: the Lumpini Stadium boxing crowd.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Matthew Deane, as he is usually called, is an actor, model, singer and athlete. The Australian-born 41-year-old is also a serious devotee of Muay Thai, and even owns a boxing gym. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">He was a master of ceremonies at the Lumpini Stadium match, stepping into the ring to interview boxers and promoters and hand out prizes to winners of a raffle.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The air-conditioned hall was hosting the first big Muay Thai event of the season. Eleven bouts started at 6 p.m and ended just after midnight. The crowd of about 5,000 roared every time punches and kicks were exchanged.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe were squeezed against each other. Normally the place isn\u2019t that crowded,\u201d said Suwan Jitpinit, who traveled from his hometown in Sukhothai province, a 420-kilometer (260-mile) drive.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAt other regular events, there would be about 1,500 to 2,000 people in the stadium but because this was a special match, there were many more people,\u201d recalled the 37-year-old boxing writer. He stayed in Bangkok for a match at another stadium before going home on March 10.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On the drive home, he began to feel feverish and was shivering so much he had to ask someone else to drive. When he arrived that evening, he went to a local hospital and was diagnosed with tonsillitis. Not feeling any better three days later, he sought help from a bigger hospital in nearby Phitsanulok. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">After hearing the news about Matthew Deane, he asked to be tested for coronavirus. The result came back positive. His wife was infected too, and their village in Sukhothai is now under quarantine.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Ordinary boxing fans from other provinces, both near Bangkok and in the north, the northeast and the south, have also tested positive for the disease.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Among them: a local politician who is especially diligent in attending to his constituents in a province east of Bangkok. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">According to reports in the Thai media, between the time he attended the Lumpini match and when he tested positive, Kitti Paopiamsap, head of the Chachoengsao provincial administration organization, attended six weddings, six funerals, three community meetings (two of them with the elderly), three Buddhist ordinations, three fairs and at least four other public meetings.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt is sad that the boxing event has aggravated the situation,\u201d said Pinit Polkhan, who shared announcing duties with Matthew Deane and like him caught the virus. \u201cCertainly, the boxing industry is taking a hard hit, and the whole country as well.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">_____</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Associated Press writer Busaba Sivasomboon contributed to this report.</p>"]}

Officials say they will only lift the quarantine after Wuhan goes 14 consecutive days with no new cases.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Police in December had reprimanded eight doctors including Li for warning friends on social media about the emerging threat. China\u2019s supreme court later criticized the police, but the ruling party continued to tighten its grip on information about the outbreak. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The party has faced similar accusations of bungling or thuggish behavior following previous disasters. They include the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a 2005 chemical spill that disrupted water supplies to millions of people in China\u2019s northeast, sales of tainted milk that sickened thousands of children and the failure of private finance companies after the global economic crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In each case, officials were accused of trying to conceal or delay information people said they needed to protect themselves.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The party often responds by allowing the public to vent temporarily, then uses its control of media and the internet to stifle criticism. Critics who persist can be jailed on vague charges of spreading rumors or making trouble. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The treatment of Li\u2019s case may reflect concerns among the leadership about public anger over the failure to properly honor the sacrifices of front-line health workers while praising the party and its head, Xi Jinping, who has tightened controls on society since taking power in 2012. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The most powerful Chinese leader since at least the 1980s, Xi gave himself the option of remaining president for life by changing the Chinese constitution in 2018 to remove a two-term limit. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Wuhan, local leaders were accused of telling doctors in December not to publicize the spreading virus in order to avoid casting a shadow over the annual meeting of a local legislative body. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">As the virus spread, doctors were ordered to delete posts on social media that appealed for donations of medical supplies.

Even rural hospitals were strained as people increasingly felt the pandemic closing in.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the farming community of Vidalia, Georgia, Dr. Robert Wagner said medical staffers at his emergency room are wearing face masks for their entire 12-hour shifts and changing in and out of full protective gear every time they see people considered a potential coronavirus case \u2014 all while dealing with a regular flow of patients injured in car crashes and suffering chest pains or other maladies. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">They are testing an increasing number of patients for the virus and worried that the 50-bed Meadows Regional Medical Center could eventually become overwhelmed.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThere\u2019s definitely this underlying fear in the community. You can see it,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Washington, negotiators from Congress and the White House resumed top-level talks on a ballooning $1 trillion-plus economic rescue package, urged by President Donald Trump to strike a deal to steady a nation thoroughly upended by the coronavirus pandemic. Trump continued to strike a confident tone about the nation\u2019s ability to defeat the pandemic soon, even as health leaders nationwide acknowledged that the U.S. is nowhere near the peak for the outbreak.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe are going to be celebrating a great victory in the not too distant future,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The contagion is starting to be felt in U.S. cities far from major metropolitan areas, including places that have resisted drastic shutdown measures. About 150 countries now have confirmed cases, and deaths have been reported in more than 30 American states. There are now more than 300,000 confirmed cases worldwide, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">New hot spots are surfacing by the day. Among the new concerns: an outbreak at a nursing home in Ohio, an outbreak in New Orleans that alarmed state leaders and two new deaths in Kansas, where a top health official said the supply of testing kits won\u2019t last through the weekend.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Debbie Velarde is self-isolated at her home in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, Colorado, after learning this week that a woman she trained during a work trip in Phoenix in early March had tested positive and was hospitalized on a respirator. Velarde then came down with a fever and cough and lost her job, and is still waiting to hear back if she tested positive for COVID-19.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI couldn\u2019t go back to work even if I was well because the mall where my shop is has since closed,\u201d said Velarde. \u201cWe were told to apply for unemployment.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Nebraska, 81 counties are without intensive-care beds, and 28 of the most rural counties have no hospital at all. In western Minnesota, five health care organizations were teaming up to convert part of a former prison into a center to care for coronavirus patients. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The shortage of medical equipment and protective gear was a concern in major cities too. Supplies including protective gear, respirators and hand sanitizer were dwindling. New Hampshire\u2019s largest hospital, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical center, encouraged volunteers to sew face masks for patients, visitors and staff so medical-grade protective equipment could be conserved for health care workers. Integris Health, in Oklahoma, was asking the public to donate masks, hand sanitizers, disposable gloves and other supplies.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">When people realize that the virus is in their community, \u201cthe anxiety kicks in, and they are rushing to the emergency room,\u201d Integris spokeswoman Brooke Cayot said. \u201cIt\u2019s the emergency rooms that are feeling overrun at the moment (by) people who are frightened and understandably so.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, tested negative for the coronavirus, his press secretary tweeted. They were tested after a member of his staff tested positive.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">John Hopkins reports there have been about 13,000 deaths globally. The United States has seen more than 280 deaths so far. Italy, which has Europe\u2019s largest outbreak, now has at least 4,825 dead.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">For most people, the new virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority recover.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But the virus is spreading at a rapid rate, jolting the global economy and starting to max out the health care system in several cities.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Italy, local authorities in the hard-hit northern regions have been pleading with the national government to enact stricter measures. Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte told the nation he was tightening a lockdown and shutting down all production facilities except those providing essential goods and services. He cautioned citizens to be calm and patient, saying there\u2019is no alternative. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cOur sacrifice in staying home is minimum compared to that of other citizens trying to keep the nation well and functioning,\u201d he said in a Facebook address. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it was ready to fly mobile medical teams and disinfection equipment to Italy, and a plane delivered more than 100 tons of supplies from China to the Czech Republic as part of a NATO program. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Spain now has the third-highest number of infections worldwide, followed by the U.S.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Spanish health authorities have acknowledged that some intensive care units in the hardest-hit areas are close to their limit. The army was building a field hospital with 5,500 beds in a convention center in Madrid, where hotels are also being turned into wards for virus patients without serious breathing problems.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Dr. Olga Mediano, who treated victims of a 2004 jihadi bomb attack in Madrid that killed nearly 200 people and wounded many more, said nothing prepared her for the national health tragedy Spain is now enduring.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis cannot be withstood much longer,\u201d Mediano said from Guadalajara. \u201cWe are doubling up on our shifts. We have strategies to hang in there this week, but beyond that we need the situation to improve because we professionals are bearing a lot of pressure, including emotional.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Germany\u2019s southern state of Bavaria, town squares were empty. Pigeons outnumbered people in London\u2019s usually bustling Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square, and the British government told up to 1.5 million sick and vulnerable people to stay home for at least 12 weeks. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Britain still lags behind other countries in the spread of the virus, but its overstretched health system is creaking. Britain has already asked 65,000 retired nurses and doctors to return to work.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Workers near Moscow are rushing to build a clinic to treat hundreds of coronavirus patients as Russia prepares for a wave of infections. Placards in the style of Soviet propaganda posters have been erected near the site, with one showing a mayor pointing at the viewer and the slogan \u201cBuilders \u2014 Minutes count!\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the global pandemic was first detected, went a fourth consecutive day on Sunday without reporting any new or suspected cases of the virus. Wuhan must go 14 straight days without a new case in order for draconian travel restrictions to be lifted, but already, a special train returned more than 1,000 car factory employees for the first time since the outbreak. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">China reported 46 new cases over the previous 24 hours, 45 of them coming from overseas. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Palestinian Health Ministry announced the first two cases of the coronavirus in the Gaza Strip, adding fears of a potential outbreak in the crowded enclave with an overstretched health system following years of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade and Palestinian political division.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Back in the U.S., restrictions on movement were scheduled to take effect Saturday in Illinois and New Jersey and Sunday in New York, where the governor invoked 9/11 in calling for the state to come together in the midst of a historic crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cYes, we have a problem. Yes, we will deal with it. Yes, we will overcome it. But let\u2019s find our better selves in doing it, and let New York lead the way in finding their better selves and demonstrating their better selves,\u201d Cuomo said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">D\u2019Emilio reported from Rome.

According to government figures, the Netherlands has a 44% share of the world trade in floriculture products and accounts for 77% of flower bulbs sold worldwide. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some Dutch farmers have resorted to giving away tulips to health care workers as a token of appreciation for their work.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It\u2019s not only growers in the Netherlands who are hurting. The pain has spread to farmers elsewhere in Europe and to African nations like Kenya and Ethiopia which have developed significant flower industries.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Kenya the grading hall at Maridadi Flowers farm, where 120 people usually work, is deserted. The few staff still there cut roses and load them onto carts that are pushed to a dumping site where huge mounds of discarded flowers \u2014 230,000 to 250,000 each day \u2014pile up.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Owner Jack Kneppers, a Dutchman who has been working in Kenya for decades, said about 80% of his staff of 720 is now at home. He is keeping a skeleton staff to maintain the plants at the farm near the shores of Lake Naivasha, 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThis is costing us about half a million dollars a month to maintain the company,\u201d Kneppers said. \u201cIf this continues for much longer we have to start laying off people because we can\u2019t afford this.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At Royal FloraHolland\u2019s cavernous auction facility in Aalsmeer near Amsterdam, rows of flower racks stand empty. Workers driving electric trolleys shift boxes of flowers around, but only a fraction of the usual numbers are being traded.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The cooperative, which had turnover last year of 4.7 billion euros, is asking suppliers to send only around 25% of their usual number of flowers to be auctioned to prevent tipping unsold flowers into shredding machines.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Frans van der Slot, Henk\u2019s cousin, is keeping his tulips in cold storage for as long as possible in an attempt to ride out the worst of the slump. He\u2019s hoping sales will recover around Easter on April 12, but if there\u2019s no rebound, he will have to dump most of his harvest.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Earlier this week he threw out a batch of bulbs because it wasn\u2019t economically viable to plant them. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThey fed them to cows,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were first-class bulbs.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The coronavirus crisis couldn\u2019t have hit at a worst time.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the peak spring season, fields around the Netherlands burst into vibrant colors as tulips and other flowers bloom. Sunday is Mother\u2019s Day in Britain, but even that has not helped an industry brought to its knees.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kenya\u2019s farmers sell some 70% of their produce to Europe.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cAs we speak right now figures are changing every day, but by yesterday we were operating at 30%, that means 70% lower than we have ever done,\u201d said Clement Tulezi, CEO of the Kenya Flower Council. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kneppers says it\u2019s the worst he\u2019s ever seen.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">One of his workers, Carol Gikundi, a single mom with three children who also cares for her mother, is worried. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWe are scared our jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re scared also for our employees because all our dependents are currently looking up to us and we are not certain of our jobs due to the outbreak.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In the Netherlands, Frans van der Slot has set up a stall outside his farm to sell flowers he can\u2019t send to auction.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A Dutch tricolor flag flaps in the wind above a sign urging passers-by to \u201cBuy local tulips Now.\u201d A bunch of 50 flowers costs 5 euros ($5.40), far less than they sell for in stores and markets across the Netherlands.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cStopping isn\u2019t an option,\u201d said Van der Slot. \u201cThen I have to let my business go bankrupt and I lose all my savings.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">____</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Mwihia reported from Naivasha, Kenya.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

She said her brother expressed his gratitude for Trump\u2019s letter.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">North Korea has repeatedly said there hasn\u2019t been a single case of the coronavirus on its soil. Some foreign experts question that claim and say an outbreak in the North could cause a humanitarian disaster because of its poor medical infrastructure. Last month, the State Department expressed concerns about North Korea\u2019s vulnerability to a potential coronavirus outbreak and said it was ready to support efforts by aid organizations to contain the spread of the illness in the North.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There was no immediate comment from the White House.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kim Yo Jong said Trump\u2019s letter is \u201ca good example showing the special and firm personal relations\u201d between the North Korean and U.S. leaders. But she said it\u2019s not a good idea to \u201cmake hasty conclusion or be optimistic about\u201d the prospect for bilateral relations. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIn my personal opinion, I think that the bilateral relations and dialogue for them would be thinkable only when the equilibrium is kept dynamically and morally and justice ensured between the two countries,\u201d she said. \u201cEven at this moment we are working hard to develop and defend ourselves on our own under the cruel environment which the U.S. is keen to \u2018provide.\u2019\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Earlier, Trump sent birthday greetings to Kim Jong Un, who was believed to have turned 36 on Jan. 8. Senior North Korean official Kim Kye Gwan said at the time that the birthday messages won\u2019t lead his country to return to talks unless the U.S. accepts its demands.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kim and Trump have met three times and exchanged letters and envoys on many occasions since 2018, when they launched talks on the fate of Kim\u2019s advancing nuclear arsenal. The two leaders have avoided harsh language against each other and Trump once said he and Kim \u201cfell in love.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But their diplomacy has largely come to a standstill since the breakdown of their second summit in Vietnam in February 2019, when Trump rejected Kim\u2019s demands for broad sanctions relief in return for a partial disarmament step.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Kim pressed Trump to come up with new proposals to salvage the negotiations by the end of last year. Kim later vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent, unveil \u201ca new strategic weapon\u201d and warned he would no longer be bound by a major weapons test moratorium.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In recent weeks, North Korea has fired a slew of artillery and other rockets into the sea in what experts say is an attempt to improve its military capabilities. The weapons were all short range and did not pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland. A resumption of long-range missile or nuclear weapons tests by Kim would likely completely scuttle diplomacy with Trump, experts say.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">KCNA said Kim watched the test firing of tactical guided weapons on Saturday with Kim Yo Jong and other top officials. South Korea\u2019s military called the demonstration \u201cvery inappropriate\u201d at a time when the world is struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">South Korea\u2019s military said Saturday it detected two presumed short-range ballistic missiles that flew from a site in western North Korea across the country and landed in the waters off the east coast.

For now, 2,500 division paratroopers remain in the Middle East on standby. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">It\u2019s intense training like the exercise in Colombia that allows the soldiers to deploy with lightning speed. Their readiness inspired the old saying around Fort Bragg: \u201cWhen the president dials 911, the 82nd\u202fanswers the phone.\u201d The division, with nearly 18,000\u202fparatroopers, operates under a constant state of readiness, rotating soldiers on and off standby.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press was given rare access to accompany the group on its January joint training mission with Colombia, amid a humanitarian crisis in neighboring Venezuela that has sent hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees fleeing over the border. U.S. diplomatic and political efforts to replace Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro with opposition leader Juan Guaido have been unsuccessful. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">There have been no signs pointing to potential military intervention by the U.S. or Colombia. But as the United States has spent billions of dollars restoring peace and building a partnership in a region that\u2019s heavily influenced by Russia and Iran, cementing relationships like the one with Colombia is key to U.S. strategy.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">U.S. and Colombian forces spend several days mapping out the exercise, which simulates the securing of an air base. They spend hours jumping off elevated wooden platforms and practicing their landings in what resemble oversized sandboxes.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to jump with the 82nd\u202fAirborne Division,\u201d Colombian\u202fMaj.

Juan Dominguez sits on the floor and pulls at a maze of straps on his rucksack. The 33-year-old joined the U.S. Army at 27, later than many of his comrades. It was always a dream, but his wife and five children needed to be taken care of before he enlisted. He said he wants \u201cto show my kids that even though I\u2019m afraid of heights, you can overcome pretty much anything.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">At 4 a.m. on jump day, Sgt. 1st Class Nathan Fair and the soldiers of Bravo Company 325th\u202fInfantry Regiment rise and begin loading their gear onto buses bound for the airfield. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">This is Fair\u2019s second stint in the military. The 37-year-old left in 2006 but realized civilian life wasn\u2019t his speed.\u202f\u201cYou miss the little things, like how easy it is to fall asleep on a gravel road on the range, with rocks digging into your back and you\u2019re so ridiculously exhausted that you can just fall asleep anywhere,\u201d he said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Fair calls himself a \u201csuper-patriot\u201d and is fiercely proud of the soldiers he leads: \u201cThey\u2019re motivated, they\u2019re in shape, they\u2019re funny, they\u2019re quick-witted, they\u2019re aggressive. They\u2019re alpha males and that\u2019s the kind of men you want on the front lines defending you.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On this mission, only one paratrooper sent from Fort Bragg is a woman \u2014 the division, much like the Army, is mostly men. Senior medic Sgt. Sara Sanders grew up hearing about the 82nd\u2019s legacy from her father and grandfather, both paratroopers. \u201cEveryone grew up wanting to be professional ballerinas,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018No, I want to be in the Army.\u2019\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">On jump day, all the members\u2019 preparation is put to a test. The soldiers are nervous but calm. (And if any say they aren\u2019t, \u201cthey\u2019re either lying to you or have something wrong upstairs,\u201d Staff Sgt. Wesley Lee says.) </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Packed into the C-130, waiting for the flashing green light that tells them it\u2019s time to jump, they are no longer Americans or Colombians. They are just soldiers, focused on their task.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Maj. Gen. Daniel Walrath is first out the door. The jump \u2014 his first in 10 years \u2014 is a sign of leadership to his soldiers and a symbol of friendship to the Colombian general leading the way through the door on the other side of the airplane.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">One by one, Colombian and American paratroopers follow, stepping off the ledge and spiraling downward. As each jumps, a white canopy unfolds above, slowing their fall but not the pace of their breath. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The division declares the exercise a success, with only one minor injury: a broken bone on the Colombian side. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The next day, the troops from both nations gather on Tolemaida Air Base. They have earned the right to wear one another\u2019s jump wings. For Fair, this is not just an alliance on paper; it\u2019s a bond among soldiers. \u201cAnd if it comes to it, and we have to fight together,\u201d he said, \u201cthey know we\u2019ve got each other\u2019s backs.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Follow Morgan at <a

With coronavirus having such a long time of no symptoms in some cases, it means that we could actually put those gorillas at risk.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Even existing measures may not be enough to protect them. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">According to Ugandan conservationist Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka with Conservation Through Public Health, a study published this year by her group and Ohio University showed that measures in place to protect gorillas from humans are not effective in practice. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The rule on keeping a safe distance from the gorillas was broken almost every time a group of tourists visited, she said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cWhat the research found is that the 7-meter rule was broken almost all the time \u2026 like 98% of the time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what was interesting is that 60% of the time it was tourists that broke it and 40% of the time it was the gorillas who broke it.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">If close interaction cannot be prevented, she said, one measure that could potentially improve safety is requiring tourists to wear masks at all times. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Uganda has not announced a shutdown of gorilla tourism, although tourist traffic from Europe and elsewhere has dwindled. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">A spokesman for the Uganda Wildlife Authority, Bashir Hangi, said the decision on whether to shut down gorilla tourism is now academic as there is almost no business amid the outbreak. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Still, he said, the few tourists who come are screened for fever and other symptoms and must obey rules such as not standing within 7 meters (21 feet) of a gorilla family. Visitors from virus-affected countries who have gone through quarantine in Uganda need to produce what he called a certificate of isolation before they are permitted to track the gorillas. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Amos Wekesa, whose Great Lakes Safaris organizes gorilla tours in Rwanda and Uganda, spoke mournfully of \u201chardly any business\u201d as tourists postpone visits or seek refunds. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The region\u2019s mountain gorilla population dropped sharply in the past century because of poaching, illness and human encroachment. Mountain gorillas have been listed as critically endangered or endangered since 1996, although their numbers are now said to be growing as a result of conservation efforts. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">But there have been painful losses. Some gorillas die of natural causes, falling from trees or being killed in fights between males for territory or dominance. A lightning strike killed four mountain gorillas in February.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In Rwanda, where tourism is the top foreign exchange earner, the government has prioritized the protection of gorillas, even launching a naming ceremony for baby primates. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Tourism revenue is key in protecting mountain gorillas as authorities can use some of the money to help local communities or invest in anti-poaching activities. A gorilla tracking permit costs up to $600 in Uganda, and thousands of tourists pay each year. A similar permit costs upward of $1,000 in Rwanda. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Some worry the loss of tourist revenue during the coronavirus pandemic could further expose the primates to poachers. Virunga, established in 1925 as Africa\u2019s first national park and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has long been vulnerable in a volatile part of eastern Congo. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cI think this is going to have a huge impact on their sustainability,\u201d Kahumbu, the Kenyan conservationist, said of Virunga. \u201cI call on all donors and governments that support these national parks in Africa to make it easy for the parks that need to shut down to do so and survive.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Poachers could do even more damage to gorillas if they think the anti-poaching efforts have been reduced, she said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Tina Smole in Kampala, Uganda, contributed. </p>"]}

And even in the current pandemic, any payout to stricken countries would barely make a dent into what the outbreak has cost them.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Former World Bank chief economist Lawrence Summers has described the bonds as \u201cfinancial goofiness.\u201d The bonds were launched in the aftermath of the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and the current coronavirus outbreak is exposing flaws in their design.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe countries that need help are not the ones getting the funds,\u201d said Felix Stein of the University of Cambridge, who has researched the bonds. \u201cIt\u2019s the Wall Street investors that are benefiting.\u2033</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The bonds are a form of disaster insurance and work essentially like this: the World Bank sells bonds to private sector investors, who get a yearly return, partly paid for by donor countries. If an epidemic occurs, the investors lose the capital they initially used to buy the bonds. That money is sent as aid to countries affected by the epidemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The problem, experts say, is that investors like Baillie Gifford and Amundi and Oppenheimer were getting high returns - as much as 11% a year.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">And the bonds required a certain number of people to die before countries receive any payout, among other conditions, complicating any immediate efforts to snuff out the virus.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Upon their launch, the bonds were described by the World Bank as a way \u201cto help prevent a high-severity infectious disease outbreak from becoming a pandemic\u201d by making essential financing available to key responders.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">According to the bonds\u2019 criteria, 12 weeks must pass before a payout for a coronavirus epidemic can be made. The outbreak must also be sustained, have affected at least two countries, and have caused at least 250 deaths.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The World Bank said that date would be met on March 23 and that a decision for a payout would then be made by an independent agency. The bank said the maximum potential payout was about $196 million. Only the world\u2019s poorest countries are eligible for funds, making any immediate pay-out unlikely, as the hardest-hit countries include China, Italy, Iran, Spain and South Korea.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Taxpayers in Australia, Germany and Japan and the International Development Association, meanwhile, have put up about $176 million so far to back the bonds.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">In a 2019 paper published in the BMJ, Clare Wenham of the London School of Economics and a colleague found that as of last year, the pandemic bonds had paid nearly $115 million to investors while providing only $61 million via a \u201ccash window\u201d mechanism to Congo, for its most recent Ebola epidemic.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wenham said the payout conditions are too arbitrary and long. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cBy the time the required number of people die in a certain number of countries, the pandemic is clearly going to have spread quite significantly,\u201d she said, describing the mechanism as \u201cflawed\u201d and overcomplicated. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">To date, the new coronavirus has infected more than 307,000 people and killed over 13,000. The illness has been deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization, meaning it will likely reach every country in the world. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Some 92,000 have already recovered from the virus, mostly in China.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Wenham said the bonds might work better if the payout was linked to another trigger, like when the WHO declares a global health emergency like it did in late January.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cIf the whole idea is to help prevent a pandemic, it doesn\u2019t make sense to wait until the pandemic is spreading before paying out,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Olga Jonas, an economist at Harvard University who previously worked at the World Bank, says it\u2019s unclear why the pandemic bonds are even necessary.</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">\u201cThe World Bank has ample financial capacity to finance responses to outbreaks because it has $29 billion of liquid assets,\u201d she said. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">Earlier this month, the World Bank announced it would make $14 billion available to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The bank declined to say if the pandemic bonds would be continued in another form after COVID-19. </p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\"> ___</p>", "<p class=\"Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69\">The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
