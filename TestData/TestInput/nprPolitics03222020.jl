Bernie Sanders on Tuesday because the demographics of the states voting tend to favor him.</p>", "<p>So much has changed since the <a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/liveblogs/20200310-primaries/\">last round of primaries</a> just a week ago. Coronavirus is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/812054919/the-coronavirus-crisis\">dominating everything</a>, and elections are on the back burner. </p>", "<p>Some states have postponed their primaries over coronavirus concerns, and officials in Ohio, which is one of the four big states that was supposed to vote Tuesday, have <a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/liveblogs/20200317-primaries/#and-then-there-were-three-12\">suspended</a> in-person voting.</p>", "<p>But primaries go on in Florida, Illinois and Arizona. It's a crucial set of contests. Former Vice President Joe Biden has an approximately <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/799979293/how-many-delegates-do-the-2020-presidential-democratic-candidates-have\">150-delegate lead </a>over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and 441 delegates are at stake Tuesday.</p>", "<p>The candidates and their allies have spent nearly $18 million on ads in the three states voting Tuesday, with Sanders a little ahead of Biden. But Biden is favored to increase his delegate lead because the demographics of the states overall tend to favor him. </p>", "<p>Here's a state-by-state guide on what to watch:</p>", "<p><strong>Delegates at stake:</strong> 219<br><strong>Final polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. ET (most polls close at 7 p.m. ET, but the western part of the Panhandle is in the Central time zone).</p>", "<p>This is the day's biggest prize, and Biden is the heavy favorite, leading in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/fl/florida_democratic_presidential_primary-6847.html\">polls by 40 points</a>.</p>", "<p>Why? Biden has been winning older voters and black voters by wide margins, while Sanders has been winning younger voters. And Florida, on a whole, is a relatively older state. About 1 in 5 Florida residents is older than 65, higher than the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/FL,US/PST045219\">national average of 16%</a>.</p>", "<p>In the 2016 Democratic primary, when Hillary Clinton beat Sanders there by more than 30 points, a quarter of voters were 65 and older, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/primaries/polls/FL/Dem\">exit polls</a>. Just 15% were younger than 30, lower than other states where Sanders has done well. </p>", "<p>More than a quarter of Democratic voters were black, and while 20% were Latino \u2014 and Sanders has been doing well with Latinos \u2014 Florida's Hispanic population is different than the Hispanic population in the Southwest. In Florida there are fewer Latinos from Mexico and more from Puerto Rico and Cuba. Does Sanders maintain his margins with Latinos, given those differences? </p>", "<p><strong>Delegates at stake: </strong>155<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 8 p.m. ET</p>", "<p>Illinois has a significant chunk of delegates. In 2016, Clinton narrowly beat Sanders by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/primaries/illinois\">less than 2 points</a>.</p>", "<p>Illinois also has a sizable share of black voters, and more than half the state's vote in 2016 came from Chicago's county. That year, 28% of the Democratic electorate was African American. Clinton won them by a huge margin. And Clinton won the urban areas of the state. Sanders, though, won white voters, especially white men \u2014 64% to 35% \u2014 and he cleaned up in the more rural areas. Does Biden cut into those margins, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/11/814298678/the-democratic-nomination-is-now-in-view-for-joe-biden-and-6-other-takeaways\">like he did in Michigan</a>?</p>", "<p>Biden has been <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/il/illinois_democratic_primary-7036.html\">leading by a lot in polls</a>, but this is the kind of state in which Sanders needs to make a stand to show he can change the narrative of this campaign.</p>", "<p><strong>Delegates at stake: </strong>67<br><strong>Polls close: </strong>10 p.m. ET</p>", "<p>Clinton won the Arizona primary by 18 points, and Biden is ahead in the polls by a <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/az/arizona_democratic_primary-6898.html\">wide margin</a>, too.</p>", "<p>There were no exit polls in the 2016 election in Arizona, and the wild card here is Latinos. While Arizona is 32% Hispanic, they made up just 15% of the 2016 electorate in the general election between President Trump and Clinton. The Arizona Democratic Party estimates that Latinos make up 36% of state Democrats, but whether they show up in those numbers in the primary could make the difference in whether Sanders has a chance here.</p>", "<p>For places to watch, almost three-quarters of the vote comes from the counties that include Phoenix and Tucson. In most years, that makes campaigning in Arizona fairly easy. </p>", "<p>But this year, with the novel coronavirus, both campaigns have canceled events. Even Sunday's debate, which was supposed to take place in Phoenix, was moved to a Washington TV studio with no audience out of caution for spreading the virus.</p>", "<p>Turnout has been up in the Democratic presidential primaries, but how coronavirus fear affects turnout across these three states is going to be a big thing to watch. </p>", "<p><em>NPR news assistant Elena Moore contributed to this report.</em> </p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

And 48 of the 50 states (Maine and Nebraska are the exceptions) have been awarding those electoral votes on a winner-takes-all basis.</p>", "<p>But <em>New York Times</em> journalist Jesse Wegman says it doesn't have to be that way: \"The way the Electoral College operates today is not carved in stone,\" he says. \"The winner-take-all rule is really just a state invention. There's nothing keeping us from changing it to a different method.\"</p>", "<p>In his new book, <em>Let the People Pick the President</em>, Wegman makes a case for abolishing the Electoral College. He notes that the winner-takes-all model means that millions of voters become irrelevant to a presidential election that is often decided by voters in key \"battleground\" states.</p>", "<p>\"There are millions of Republicans in 'blue' California and there are millions of Democrats in 'red' Texas,\" he says. \"All of those people just disappear when it's time to actually cast the electoral votes, because those states use winner-take-all.\"</p>", "<p>Wegman notes that there have been more than 700 attempts to reform or abolish the Electoral College since its inception. Recently, states began working together to create the <a href=\"https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation\">National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</a>, which would award the Electoral College votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote.</p>", "<p>\"If you're okay with the way the Electoral College works right now, which is with a statewide winner-take-all rule in almost all states, I just don't see what the argument is against using the winner-take-all rule, but for the whole country,\" Wegman says.</p>", "<p>The Case for Abolishing the Electoral College</p>", "<p class=\"author\">by <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/books/authors/817506307/jesse-wegman\"><span>Jesse Wegman</span></a></p>", "<p>Hardcover, 272 pages <span class=\"pipe\">|</span></p>", "<p class=\"support\">Your purchase helps support NPR programming. <a href=\"https://help.npr.org/customer/portal/articles/2168887-how-can-my-online-purchases-support-npr-programming\">How?</a></p>", "<p><strong>On how the Electoral College works</strong></p>", "<p>Here are the basics: The Electoral College in the Constitution is very simple. It just says each state gets a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress. So that means the number of House of Representatives members that that state has [plus] two senators. So take a state like Wyoming. ... They get one House member and they have two senators. One plus two is three. So Wyoming gets three electoral votes. No state can get fewer than three electoral votes. Then you go all the way up to California, which has 53 members in the House, plus its two senators. So it has 55 electoral votes.</p>", "<p>Beyond that, the states make all the decisions. They decide how those electors are going to be chosen, how they're going to be awarded. And that's what we're doing on Election Day, is we are picking the electors and deciding how they're going to be awarded to the candidates. So, for example, in 2016 in New York, all the voters come out, they vote, and whichever candidate wins the popular votes in the state, all of the electors for that candidate go to Albany, the state capital, in December to cast the actual votes to elect the president. And that's replicated in every state in the country, as I said, except for two, Maine and Nebraska.</p>", "<p><strong>On how the idea of an \"interstate compact\" agreed upon by states works </strong></p>", "<p>The whole idea of this interstate compact is based on the fact that the Constitution gives the states themselves near total authority to decide how to award their electors to the candidates. A state can, as we see today in 48 states, give all of their electors to the candidate who wins the most votes in their state. They can allocate them by congressional district, as two states \u2014 Maine and Nebraska \u2014 do. The governor, him or herself, could personally decide whom to give the electors to. The state lawmakers could decide to do this.</p>", "<p>All of these methods were contemplated at the founding. All of them have actually been used throughout American history. And what the compact does is it uses that power. But in a different way, which is to say, rather than states giving their presidential electors to the candidate who wins the most votes in that state, they instead agree by compact \u2014 which is basically a contract among states \u2014 to award all of their electors to the candidate who wins the most popular votes in the entire country. And the compact kicks in once states representing a majority of electors \u2014 270 \u2014 which is the number that you need to become president, sign onto it. So you put those two things together and it's a very simple calculus, which is the candidate who wins the most votes in the country automatically becomes the president.</p>", "<p><strong>On the states who have signed onto the compact so far</strong></p>", "<p>I think what would surprise a lot of people is to know that this compact itself, the effort itself and the response to it has been remarkably bipartisan.</p>", "<p class=\"byline\">Jesse Wegman</p>", "<p>Fifteen states right now are member states of this compact, plus the District of Columbia for a total of 196 electoral votes. ... All of these states were controlled by Democrats when they passed the compact. They started with Maryland in 2007 and [in] 2019 we got, I think, a wave of new states joining as Democrats won back statehouses and governorships following the 2018 midterms.</p>", "<p>It's not surprising on one level, because Democrats are the party that lost both in 2000 and 2016, you know, lost, even though winning the popular vote. So you can understand the frustration. But I think what would surprise a lot of people is to know that this compact itself, the effort itself and the response to it has been remarkably bipartisan. ...<strong> </strong>It's a bipartisan group of people. It's Republicans, some Trump-supporting Republicans as well as some very liberal Democrats. They've been working together for more than a decade on this. And they've actually won over a lot of Republican lawmakers in a lot of states. In fact, the compact has passed Republican-led chambers in four different states.</p>", "<p>What ended up happening was the 2016 election. Right before that election, you had three states that are led by Republicans, what we would call \"red\" states, that were on the verge of passing this compact and joining it along with the \"blue\" states that are currently members. As soon as the 2016 election happened and people realized the sort of the repartisaning of the Electoral College happened. It was off the table.</p>", "<p>The winner-take-all rule that all these states use today and that I think most Americans assume is just the way the Electoral College works is purely state-designed. It's purely extra-constitutional. States adopt it for one very specific reason, which is it gives them extra clout in the election.</p>", "<p class=\"byline\">Jesse Wegman</p>", "<p><strong>On how winner-take-all is not written into the Constitution </strong></p>", "<p>This is what's fascinating. It's nowhere in the Constitution. None of this is in the Constitution except for the number of electors that each state gets. They decide everything after that fact. So the winner-take-all rule that all these states use today and that. I think, most Americans assume is just the way the Electoral College works, is purely state-designed. It's purely extra-constitutional. States adopt it for one very specific reason, which is it gives them extra clout in the election.</p>", "<p><strong>On the problem with winner-take-all states being battleground states</strong></p>", "<p>That's the fundamental problem here, which is that when you use a winner-take-all system statewide, most states are going to fall into what we call the safe category, which is they are polling far enough in favor of one candidate or the other that nobody has to pay attention to them. Take California: It's right now a very solidly Democratic state. You know that California is going to cast more votes for the Democrat than for the Republican. Texas, same in the other direction. The vast majority of states fall into that category right now.</p>", "<p>That leaves us with roughly 10 to 12 states each year, each presidential election year, that you call battleground states. And those are states where the outcome is too close to predict in advance. And that means that the candidates spend essentially all of their time, all of their money, put all of their focus on those states. And really, it's fewer this year than 10 or 12. I would say it's six, maybe seven at most. And we know which they are: Wisconsin; Pennsylvania; Michigan; Arizona; North Carolina and Florida. Maybe we could add in one or two more, New Hampshire. Basically, those states are the states that are going to decide the election, because you can allocate all the rest of the electors in advance. And that's just fundamentally at odds with this idea that we're holding a national election that should be decided by all the people being treated equal by the candidates.</p>", "<p><strong>On how the Electoral College disproportionately affects voters of color</strong></p>", "<p>In the South right now, millions and millions of votes by black citizens basically don't count for anything, because white citizens in that state are enough of a majority to always ... win all of the electors in those states. So black voters in the South who vote for Democrats \u2014 which means virtually all blacks right now \u2014 are essentially invisible in every presidential election. So you see these patterns replicating themselves throughout our history. The people who stopped the popular vote amendment in the late 1960s were Southern segregationists. Some of the people who prevented us from getting to a popular vote in the founding of the country were slave holders. Again and again, the pattern repeats itself.</p>", "<p><strong>On why abolishing the Electoral College would lead to more moderate politics </strong></p>", "<p>When candidates run for president now, they really only have to worry about the interests of small numbers of voters. So, for example, what do you know people in Ohio want, or what do people in Florida or Wisconsin want? I think that leads to candidates who are naturally going to be more extreme, more divisive. They don't need to worry about what most voters in America want. You saw that in 2016 with Donald Trump. When you have to appeal to the vast majority of voters, you have your policies are going to, by nature, become more moderate, become more in the middle of where most Americans are. I think most Americans do not want extreme policies. They want mainstream policies. And if you are appealing to them, they are going to vote for a candidate who advances those rather than for the candidate out on the fringes.</p>", "<p><em>Sam Briger and Mooj Zadie produced and edited the audio of this interview.

Sixty percent of Americans said they had not very much or no trust at all in what they are hearing from the president. Only 37% said they had a good amount or a great deal of trust.</p>", "<p>That mistrust has been driven, at least in part, by comments by the president seeming to downplay the severity of the coronavirus. He has compared the virus to the flu, even though the administration's own experts have called it \"<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?470224-1/dr-fauci-warns-congress-coronavirus-outbreak-worse&amp;start=5761\">10 times more lethal than regular seasonal flu</a>\"; he said in February \"<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-african-american-leaders/\">One day \u2014 it's like a miracle \u2014 it will disappear</a>\"; and as recently as <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-president-bolsonaro-brazil-working-dinner-west-palm-beach-fl/\">March 7</a> said he was \"not concerned at all\" when asked about the virus spreading closer to Washington and the White House.</p>", "<p>The president's tone has since shifted.

Despite <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">6,300 cases and more than 100 deaths nationwide</a> as of Tuesday, only 56% of Americans consider the coronavirus \"a real threat,\" down 10 percentage points from February.</p>", "<p>Pollsters found that shift being driven by Republicans \u2014 40% of whom now call the coronavirus a real threat, down from 72% in February. Conversely, more than 3 in 4 Democrats now say the outbreak is a real threat.</p>", "<p>Asked about the divide, Pence said, \"I don't think you have to tell any American that the threat of the coronavirus to our population is real.

Pence is leading the administration's task force in charge of responding to the threat.</em></p>", "<p><strong>Steve Inskeep: Why don't we dive right in because I know your time is short. Can I get you to address a parent who's now at home with their kids and wondering about this and wondering how long this is going to last, how many cases there are going to be, how big is it. That's the question that's on their mind. What are your assumptions about that?</strong></p>", "<p>Vice President Pence: Well, we're continuing to study every day, data from around the world about the coronavirus. And what we know now is that the risk of a serious illness for the average American remains low. And in fact, looking at some of the global data, the risk to children also remains very low.</p>", "<p>But for seniors with chronic underlying health conditions or anyone with an immunodeficiency, there is a real threat of serious health outcomes. And it's one of the reasons why yesterday the president unveiled our coronavirus guidelines for every American. And we want every American in every state and every territory to embrace these personal habits and practices over the next 15 days. Because while younger Americans, younger families, may not be particularly at risk, the possibility that people would contract the coronavirus would, as the experts tell me, would shed virus or otherwise convey it to people in our vulnerable population is a priority.</p>", "<p>So we're just encouraging every American \u2014 people can go to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\">coronavirus.gov</a> and get these very straightforward guidelines encouraging Americans to avoid groups of 10 or more. If you feel sick, stay home. If you're an older person, we encourage you to stay home as much as possible and away from other people. And then there's also a broad range of recommendations.</p>", "<p>But it really is all about trying to focus on two things, Steve. Number one, we really believe if every American will take strong steps now over the next 15 days that we can significantly impact the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. And also, as every American puts these common sense personal habits and hygiene into practice, we're going to protect the most vulnerable among us.</p>", "<p><strong>But this is my question, you have changed and I think accelerated your response to this over the last several days. I know you've also been modeling this. You have to make policy assumptions. How many people are on their way to being sick, for example, how serious the damage to the economy will be if nothing is done. What are your assumptions about how bad this is?</strong></p>", "<p>Well, we got modeling in in the last several days, and that's what precipitated the president's decision. But let me say in Dr. Tony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, two of the leading experts in the world on infectious disease, tell us is that we are still at that point in the spread of the coronavirus in the United States, where strong action, common sense, personal hygiene and what they call social distancing for now, among every American, can significantly reduce the spread of the virus in our country.</p>", "<p><strong>But is that taking it from catastrophe to still a disaster? What is on the horizon here?</strong></p>", "<p>Well, look, there will be many thousands of Americans that contract the coronavirus. We know that. And as we expand testing, those numbers are going to be more evident to the American public every day. But what your listeners should know is that most Americans who contract the coronavirus will either have mild to serious flu-like symptoms and completely recover. Many will have no symptoms at all.</p>", "<p><strong>I respect that \u2014 </strong></p>", "<p>But our objective here, really, Steve, is \u2014 and the president has done this all along the way. It was before the end of January when this coronavirus was just coming into the consciousness of the American people. President Trump took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from China, within designated areas of South Korea and Italy for travel advisories and began screening all passengers from all airports in those countries. The president last week took action to suspend travel from Europe, now the U.K. and Ireland. And this has, we really believe, our experts tell me every day, this has bought us a significant amount of time for us to give the guidance the president published yesterday to the American people and reduce the risk of this epidemic in our country and particularly reduce the risk of serious consequences to the most vulnerable.</p>", "<p><strong>Do these efforts, these measures have to continue until there is a vaccine?</strong></p>", "<p>We think, based upon other similar viruses and what we know of what's taken place in China and in other countries, that we will essentially see what people see on television on a regular basis and on the Internet. We will see a curve. Something of a bell curve. And we believe that by this spring, because the president brought together pharmaceutical companies and asked for their collaboration, we're going to see therapeutics already being introduced into the market to give people relief \u2014</p>", "<p><strong>Treatment as opposed to \u2014</strong></p>", "<p>That contracted the coronavirus. But as the president announced just a day ago, we are already in clinical trials in record time for the development of a vaccine. But given the processes for approving a vaccine, putting the safety and health of America first, a vaccine will likely not be available for more than a year, closer to a year and a half. But therapeutic medicines, relief for Americans, because our pharmaceutical industry is responding to the president's call, we believe will be available this summer.</p>", "<p><strong>But do you have to continue the CDC guidelines, </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/17/817178765/self-isolation-orders-pit-civil-liberties-against-public-good-in-coronavirus-pan\"><strong>the shelter in place</strong></a><strong>, those things until you have a vaccine? Can you drop them soon?</strong></p>", "<p>I think what we're asking the American public to do right now, based on our best information, is in the next 15 days is to \u2014</p>", "<p><strong>But beyond that is what I'm saying.</strong></p>", "<p>Avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people, avoid eating and drinking at bars and restaurants and food courts, use the drive-through and pickup and delivery for restaurants, avoid discretionary travel.</p>", "<p>Essentially, do all of those things that our task force unveiled with the president's endorsement yesterday. And we believe that those measures are appropriate right now. We think we are early enough in this epidemic that we can significantly reduce the infection rate. But all along the way, I just promise your listeners, we're going to continue to be driven by the science, by the experts, by the datas, and we're going to give best practices to the American people.</p>", "<p><strong>Isn't the science pointing to more than 15 days though, Mr. Vice President? If we look at Italy, if we look at China, the science is pointing to a lot more than 15 days of this, is it not?</strong></p>", "<p>Well, we understand as the president said that we will likely be dealing with the coronavirus until midsummer. Just based upon what we know about its path. But that point at how many people can contract the coronavirus, how severe it becomes, we really believe, and this is why we're asking everybody to go to coronavirus.gov and put these guidelines into practice in your personal life, in your family, in your business. We think we can really impact the size and scope of this infection rate in the United States. Spare tens of thousands of Americans from contracting the coronavirus and ultimately save lives.</p>", "<p><strong>I want to try this one more time. If you're asking Congress for a trillion dollars in stimulus funding, it sounds like you're expecting a lot more than 15 more days of severe economic disruption.</strong></p>", "<p>Oh, Steve, I don't want your listeners to be confused at all. The 15 days is about measures we believe can impact the growth and expansion of the virus in the United States. But we fully expect that we will be dealing with the coronavirus in the United States for months. And as the president said yesterday, according to some of our modeling, we could well be dealing with coronavirus cases in the United States well into July.</p>", "<p>And that's why, right after all \u2014 our focus right now is to engage every American, every American business, to engage in best practices to limit the spread of the coronavirus. And we're working with Congress as we speak to make sure that we're supporting vital industries, infrastructure, our supply chains.</p>", "<p>And ultimately, I share the president's confidence. Fundamentals in this economy are so strong that as we put the health of the American people first, as we bring the very best experts to bear and the best guidelines to bear for the American people to do everything we can to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, we'll get through this. And when we do, Steve, this economy is going to come roaring back.</p>", "<p><strong>There's an </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/17/816501871/poll-as-coronavirus-spreads-fewer-americans-see-pandemic-as-a-real-threat\"><strong>NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll</strong></a><strong> which surveys American attitudes about the coronavirus. And there's an interesting finding having to do specifically with Republicans. In February, 72% of Republicans agreed that this was a real threat as opposed to something that was overblown. Today, only 40% of Republicans specifically think it is a real threat as opposed to overblown. What do you say to those of the president's supporters who think this is some kind of Democratic effort to get the president, or some kind of hoax?</strong></p>", "<p>I would say to every American that now is the time for us all to focus on exactly the kind of common sense measures that we've been advancing, that the CDC's been recommending now for many, many weeks, but that are specifically described in our 15 day plan to slow the virus, coronavirus.gov.</p>", "<p><strong>Will you tell them this is real, this is real?</strong></p>", "<p>Steve, I don't think you have to tell any American that the threat of the coronavirus to our population is real. People understand that. And they also understand that the threat of serious illness to the average American does remain low. But what we're trying to communicate is that Americans who may become exposed to the coronavirus could inadvertently expose seniors with serious underlying health conditions to the coronavirus.</p>", "<p>And that's why we really want to make it clear and everyone in the sound of my voice today should share with their family members and their friends on social media the president's guidelines to 15 days to slow the spread. Because it's not so much that an average healthy American has a great threat of the coronavirus. They may contract it. As I said, they may have flu-like symptoms. But no American wants to inadvertently spread the coronavirus to a senior with a serious underlying health condition or any other American with an immunodeficiency. We're all in this together. And with the practice of good hygiene and the social distancing the president is recommending, we'll get through it.</p>", "<p><strong>As you know, Mr. Vice President, there are conservative media figures, there are people on Fox News, even the president himself, who have said from time to time, this is, they've compared it to the flu. They've said that Democrats are overblowing this. Sometimes you hear that it's a plot to get the president. Have you, as the head of this task force, reached out to any of those prominent figures and said, \"Listen, I need you to talk about this a different way.\"</strong></p>", "<p>We're speaking to the American people every day.</p>", "<p><strong>But are you speaking privately to people about this? </strong></p>", "<p>We're speaking to the American people every day. I'm speaking to governors, as the president is every single day. Republicans and Democrats. And, Steve, as the president said many times, we're all in this together. And I have to tell you, I couldn't be more inspired. I mean, to see the partnership that we've forged with governors like Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington. I traveled to Washington myself not long ago. We're in regular contact about the unique challenges Washington's facing \u2014</p>", "<p><strong>Didn't the president call him a snake at the same time you were working with him? </strong></p>", "<p>Gov. Cuomo \u2014 look, people will always have political differences. But I tell you, there is no daylight between this president, our administration and the governors of all 50 states and our territories in combating the coronavirus and to see that seamless partnership that President Trump has forged to see it being worked out every single day. I spoke today to the governor of New Jersey. Now that we're seeing the advent of many coronavirus cases in New York, more cases in New York than any other state, sadly, and the impact that that's beginning to have in New Jersey.</p>", "<p>But I can tell you if your listeners could see what I see every single day and the way that dedicated public health officials at the federal level, at this president's leadership, governors and state and local health officials, and the way that businesses around the country are stepping up, making hard choices to put the health of their employees and the health of their customers first, they'd be just as inspired as me.</p>", "<p><strong>Two questions before I let you go, Mr. Vice President. There's another finding in this poll that speaks to the other side of the political divide. </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/17/816680033/poll-americans-dont-trust-what-they-re-hearing-from-trump-on-coronavirus\"><strong>Sixty percent of Americans</strong></a><strong> in this survey say they don't trust the president to provide reliable information in this crisis. Why do you think that would be?</strong></p>", "<p>The American people can be confident that, as we've done from the very beginning, we're going to continue to marshal the best counsel of experts to bring forward the facts to the American people. And they're also going to be confident, Steve, that President Trump is going to continue without hesitation to take steps that put the health and well-being of the American people first.</p>", "<p><strong>People don't seem to trust him though \u2014</strong></p>", "<p>I mean it really is, Dr. Fauci said this not long ago, in fact, earlier today, that when the president took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from China in January, when he took the recent step of suspending all travel from Europe, it's given the American people space and opportunity, working with one another, working with government agencies at every level to confront the coronavirus.</p>", "<p>I mean, honestly, I've been told by our experts, if the president hadn't taken the step of suspending all travel from China, we would likely look very much in this country like Europe does today.</p>", "<p><strong>This is the strange thing, though. People trust Dr. Fauci in this survey. They trust public health professionals. And yet a big majority didn't trust the president.</strong></p>", "<p>Well, the American people can trust that President Trump, his vice president, and this extraordinary White House coronavirus task force is going to continue to bring all the facts forward. We're going to listen to the counsel of actually the best medical experts in the world. And as we did with the 15 days to slow the spread yesterday, we're going to continue to give every American the tools they need to do their part.</p>", "<p>And that's the thing, Steve. Every American has a role to play in preventing a widening spread of the coronavirus across this country. And we're really calling on everyone to go to coronavirus.gov, get all the information that you need. And you're going to see that there's some tough recommendations and guidelines there. I mean, avoiding groups of more than 10 people specifically over the next 15 days. But I promise you, listening to Dr. Fauci, listening to Dr. Deborah Birx, the top experts in the world are telling us because of the strong steps President Trump has taken from early on this year, we have an opportunity to significantly reduce the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. And that'll continue to be our focus. But it's going to take all of us to do it.</p>", "<p><strong>I have a personal question to conclude with Mr. Vice President. I speak sometimes to people who have worked with you, who respect you greatly, who know you well. And they say that before important meetings, you pray. Do you pray before meetings of the coronavirus task force? And if so, what have you been praying for?</strong></p>", "<p>We pray for the American people and for all the people that are serving them every day. The health care workers that are on the frontlines coming alongside people that are being impacted by this coronavirus. And as the president did when he called for a national day of prayer this last Sunday, we know that the prayer of faithful people across this country has always brought us through challenging times. And that along with the energetic efforts of government officials, the full participation of the American people, that we'll get through this and we'll come out stronger and better than ever before.</p>", "<p><strong>Does your faith in some way inform the way that you think about this particular crisis in which there is so much at risk, so much death, so much potential destruction?</strong></p>", "<p>We pray for wisdom. We pray to offer good counsel to the president of the United States. And as I said before, having spent the last several weeks since the president asked me to lead the White House coronavirus task force, I couldn't be more proud of the team that President Trump has assembled here. The selflessness and dedication and expertise of the men and women that are working on every aspect of our nation's response. And the people that are working at the state level, our governors, our public health officials, the response of businesses large and small across this country. It really is inspiring. And I just know that as Americans, we'll get through this.</p>", "<p><strong>Mr. Vice President, thank you very much. </strong></p>", "<p>Thank you, Steve.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Their discussions included payments to small businesses, loan guarantees for industries like airlines and hotels, and a stimulus package for workers. </p>", "<p>\"We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,\" Mnuchin said at a press conference at the White House on Tuesday. \"Americans need cash now, and the president wants to get cash now. And I mean now, in the next two weeks.\" </p>", "<p>Mnuchin briefed Senate Republicans on the proposal Tuesday afternoon and has already spoken with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.</p>", "<p>\"This is a very unique situation in this economy. We've put a proposal on the table that would inject $1 trillion into the economy, that is on top of the $300 billion from the IRS deferrals. Now let me just say: This is a combination of loans, this is a combination of direct checks to individuals, this is a combination of creating liquidity for small businesses.\" </p>", "<p>The request comes as a number of lawmakers call for a quick solution for some of the country's increasingly dire economic concerns. There is growing bipartisan agreement around the need to speed direct cash aid to individuals and families.</p>", "<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is calling for any new aid  package to meet three criteria: assist individuals and families with financial challenges, secure the country's economy and economic foundation, and ready the health care system and support medical professionals.</p>", "<p>\"We're going to work here in warp speed for the Senate, which almost never does anything quickly,\" McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. \"These are not ordinary times, this is not an ordinary situation, so it requires extraordinary measures.\"</p>", "<p>McConnell said he plans to work with the White House to reach consensus among Republicans before turning to Democrats to ink a final deal. </p>", "<p>The talks are expected to move swiftly. Mnuchin told reporters after a meeting with Senate Republicans that the first concern must be about speeding relief to individuals, families and businesses, and not about the deficit or other long-term issues.</p>", "<p>\"Congress right now should be concerned about the American workers,\" Mnuchin said. \"In different times, we'll fix the deficit. This is not the time to worry about it.\" </p>", "<p>Republican senators expressed widespread support for the concept of cash payments following the lunch with Mnuchin, but many critical details of how the money will be allocated and to whom still need to be addressed. </p>", "<p>The Senate is preparing to vote first on a smaller relief bill that has already been approved in the House. That legislation includes paid sick and family leave for some workers, extended unemployment benefits, and emergency funds for food security programs.</p>", "<p>There had been some discussion about holding up the House measure to wait until the broader economic stimulus plan was crafted, but McConnell said that won't be the case. He suggested that despite some unease among members of his party to approve the measure, it should be approved. </p>", "<p>\"Gag and vote for it anyways, even if you think there's some shortcomings,\" he said of his advice for those GOP members. </p>", "<p>The top Senate Republican also committed to the Senate remaining in session to pass broader relief.</p>", "<p>\"It is my intention that the Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps, above and beyond what the House passed, to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,\" McConnell said.</p>", "<p>House leaders were forced to approve a lengthy technical correction to its legislation Monday. McConnell has predicted bipartisan support to pass that bill in the Senate but noted on Tuesday the need for \"a broader package that includes more and broader small business relief.\"</p>", "<p>McConnell has already said that he is in touch with the chairmen of eight committees about additional legislation that will be required and that bipartisanship will be key. The next steps entail providing financial aid to individuals, shoring up small businesses and protecting the health care system.</p>", "<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., jump-started specifics for a comprehensive new plan, proposing a $750 billion to raise funding for unemployment insurance, coronavirus treatment and emergency child care assistance. The plan also includes student loan and housing payment assistance, aid to small businesses and expansion of hospital and treatment capacity.</p>", "<p>The price tag eclipses the first emergency coronavirus aid bill of roughly $8 billion approved earlier this month to address response efforts. Late Monday, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/16/816251688/uncertainty-in-congress-over-next-moves-to-address-coronavirus-crisis\">the House sent a second bill to address paid sick leave and testing to the Senate</a>.</p>", "<p>\"We need big, bold, immediate federal action to deal with the crisis. The kinds of targeted measures we are putting together will mainline money into the economy and directly into the hands of families that need it most,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor in outlining the plans. \"Importantly, this proposal will ensure that our medical professionals have the resources \u2014 including physical space and equipment \u2014 they need to provide treatment and keep Americans safe.\"</p>", "<p>The talks came on the same day the stock market <a href=\"http://npr.org/2020/03/16/816382835/stocks-shudder-despite-emergency-measures\">shed nearly 3,000 points</a> in its biggest daily decline in more than 30 years and President Trump's administration announced <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/16/816268413/white-house-to-give-update-on-coronavirus-plans-and-testss\">stringent guidelines</a> to tighten public gatherings to 10 people or less. After news of the latest proposals emerged the markets did rebound some.</p>", "<p>Several senators had already released proposals for direct cash payments before the White House announcement. For example, Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney says the government should immediately issue $1,000 to every American so families can manage short-term obligations. He's also proposing small business grants, aid for higher education students and deferring student loan payments for new graduates.</p>", "<p>Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton released a separate plan Tuesday modeled on economic relief that was approved in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks and the 2008 financial crisis.</p>", "<p>His broader proposal includes a tax-rebate check of $1,000 for every adult tax filer making less than $100,000 per year and $500 for each dependent. Married couples making less than $200,000 per year would be eligible for a $2,000 rebate.</p>", "<p>The House, meanwhile, remains on a planned recess this week, which could be extended. Pelosi, who returned to her home state of California on Saturday, urged members to allow as many staff as possible to telecommute in the interim.</p>", "<p>The furious pace of proposals comes as the spreading virus continues to pose a direct threat to Capitol building operations, as several lawmakers' offices remain closed as a result of at least two coronavirus cases among current D.C-based Hill staffers.</p>", "<p>So far, no elected member of Congress has disclosed testing positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by novel coronavirus.

Regardless, he said, he would undergo testing later in the day. </p>", "<p>He also offered the latest figures on the number of Americans who have been tested: More than 195,000 people have been tested, not including those who were tested in county hospitals or health care labs around the nation. Of those, roughly 19,350 have tested positive for the coronavirus, Pence said. </p>", "<p>President Trump, who was first to speak at the news conference at the White House, ran through the list of steps the administration has taken to fight the spread of the virus, including an order for \"hundreds of millions\" of face masks and other supplies for health care professionals. </p>", "<p>\"We started with very few masks and now we're making tens of millions of masks,\" Trump said after blaming previous administrations for the stockpile shortages the country now faces.</p>", "<p>He later specified the government has issued a contract for 500 million N95 masks, saying they are \"now\" available to hospitals and other health care centers.</p>", "<p>Part of the demand for supplies is being met by the private sector in \"sixth gear,\" he said, which is heeding the call to make masks, swabs and ventilators by pivoting from their primary industries to making the desperately needed supplies.</p>", "<p>Trump praised Hanes, the cotton clothing maker, for retrofitting its manufacturing capabilities to produce masks for medical use. He also noted the shift by alcohol distilleries in Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia toward making hand sanitizer products that will be distributed throughout all 50 states. </p>", "<p>He touted his work on legislation to bring economic relief to businesses and  workers. He said his administration will give people extra time to file taxes, moving the deadline from April 15 to July 15.  Additionally, he said students will not face interest penalties or fines for delaying student loan payments.

On Friday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said there had been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/817973969/white-house-to-hold-coronavirus-briefing-as-supply-struggles-intensify\">\"tremendous progress\" in lab testing</a> and dismissed complaints about shortages as \"anecdotal.\"</p>", "<p>But groups that represent public health labs, epidemiologists and state health officials <a href=\"https://twitter.com/APHL/status/1241119254621159428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1241119254621159428&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Flegacy.npr.org%2Ftemplates%2Fpreview%2FtwitterPreview.php%3FtweetId%3D1241119254621159428%26hideMedia%3Dtrue\">said late Friday</a> that there were \"widespread shortages of laboratory supplies and reagents.\"</p>", "<p>The Association of Public Health Laboratories said testing should be reserved for health care workers and first responders, older Americans with symptoms and other people at high risk of getting seriously ill from the virus.</p>", "<p>The groups said mass testing would quickly deplete supplies, and it instead urged people with mild respiratory illness to stay at home and isolate themselves.</p>", "<p>Hospitals have also said health care workers lack masks and other gear needed to protect themselves when treating patients with the virus. Pence said on Friday that there would be an announcement this weekend about what he called \"a major acquisition\" of masks.</p>", "<p>A week ago, Trump and Pence had said there would be a website where people could find out whether they needed to be tested for the virus and direct them to nearby drive-though sites.

In-person fundraisers have come to a full stop.  Staffers who once filled campaign offices and spilled into the street are now working from home. It raises the question: When Americans from coast to coast are practicing \"social distancing,\" how do candidates campaign? </p>", "<p>For her part, Wu is one of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/massachusetts-playbook/2020/03/17/campaigns-sweat-signature-collection-ordinary-life-is-over-for-now-baker-proposes-10m-small-biz-loan-fund-488602\">roughly a dozen candidates who signed on to a letter </a> urging Massachusetts to delay the deadline to submit signatures by 30 days.

Now, there's virtual town halls and call time \u2014 hours spent huddling to call would-be supporters \u2014 but even the proposition of asking for money is fraught.</p>", "<p>\"I had three different people just yesterday who had pledged to donate to my campaign and then we got in touch with them, and they were like, 'I just lost my job,'\" she said. </p>", "<p>Candidates are facing a series of challenging choices, said Amanda Litman, a co-founder of <a href=\"https://runforsomething.net/\">Run For Something</a>, which supports first-time candidates.

Obviously that's not happening.\" </p>", "<p>Instead, they're turning to things like virtual phone banks, text messages, and digital advertising \u2014 in short, any tool at their disposal.</p>", "<p>In Suffolk County, New York, Democrat Nancy Goroff is running to challenge Republican Rep.

Jim Oberweis won a crowded, seven-way primary to take on incumbent Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood in the fall. Underwood flipped the traditionally Republican seat in a suburban Illinois district outside of Chicago in 2018. This year, it's one of the GOP's top targets. </p>", "<p>But in an interview, Oberweis says he's not thinking much about that right now.

Likewise, employees of these companies will be eligible for up to three months of paid family and medical leave, giving them two-thirds of their average monthly earnings per month if, for example, they have to take care of their kids with schools closed. The bill compensates these companies for worker leave with government money.</p>", "<p>Heather Boushey, who heads the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, thinks the bill doesn't go far enough. \"The House bill includes far too many exemptions,\" she says. The biggest one: companies with over 500 employees, which means companies like Amazon and McDonald's are not <em>required</em> to provide paid sick, medical, or family leave.</p>", "<p>The Center for Equitable Growth leans left, and Boushey is not surprisingly looking out for workers. But there are selfish reasons to expand paid leave enormously. Given how many of these big businesses work in face-to-face services, like food and hospitality, she thinks the lack of a universal mandate for sick leave is not just a public health hazard, but a hazard to the economy.</p>", "<p>Boushey, like other economists we spoke to in <a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=8eba9dbeab7daf6ed5c51269dc2bc32bd7cf3380b26f57c6235483bb3ee320d93425b5a25cdbfd9f36921a7eefe9f052ff0d4defa8373e6c\">a recent <em>Planet Money</em> episode</a>, stresses that the first priority has to be containing the virus. When people are sick or quarantined or afraid, there's not much the traditional economic toolbox can do to return us to normal times. As Austan Goolsbee told us in the episode, \"The thing about virus economics that's different from regular business-cycle economics is the most important thing you can do for the economy has nothing to do with the economy.\"</p>", "<p>Paid leave would keep way more people isolated, which is exactly what public health officials are recommending right now. And Boushey thinks that's economically sound. \"This would decrease not only the spread of coronavirus, but also the flu and other contagious diseases,\" she told us, citing <a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=8eba9dbeab7daf6ec148355df4e96143bb26634c322756ea9881bb7787e6b4b75c3c6917d80e35615874713271633e57d2102af5c631568b\">a study</a> that found that paid sick leave dramatically lowers the rate of transmission of the traditional flu. \"That's going to lower the cost of this pandemic for our society. It's going to lower the stress on our healthcare sector.\"</p>", "<p>While the bill does not force large employers to provide sick leave, <a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=8eba9dbeab7daf6e6f858a839db9178857c2148dd369cb3e2a76b441f8c73ec7b3cb87d273828c193022cae40110852fbd201966d18cc413\">around 89 percent</a> already offer some form of this policy, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But, as of 2019, the average amount of paid sick days at big employers was <a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=8eba9dbeab7daf6e3c775ed97bbb0081ce55ade28d74b5bbab78a602f5b34c87b9f60f0e1749f6c7cf8d81dd4eb8ba2274dd241c05b180e5\">eight days</a>, which is six days shy of the recommended 14-day quarantine for coronavirus.</p>", "<p>Jason Furman, former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors under President Obama, is urging the federal government to mandate that all businesses provide paid sick and family leave. But he also believes that the federal government should pick up the tab. Simply mandating it without funding it, he says, would hurt companies that are already reeling from the rapid fall of consumer demand.</p>", "<p>\"A mandate would fall disproportionately on businesses in the leisure and hospitality industry that have thin margins and are being slammed by the current crisis,\" Furman says. \"The government should pay for it for all workers.\"</p>", "<p>Such a measure would cost billions and billions of dollars, but it comes with the very real social and economic benefits of slowing the spread of COVID-19. Maybe \"sick leave\" or \"medical leave,\" with its overtones of a kind of health vacation, is the wrong phrase. Maybe we should be talking about a \"containment stipend.\"</p>", "<p><em>Did you enjoy this newsletter? Well, it looks even better in your inbox!

On Monday, the president urged Americans not to be in groups of 10 or more. His tone at that press conference was something of an about-face for the president, who appeared to be conveying the threat much more seriously.</p>", "<p>\"These numbers speak to the fact that there was not a unified message coming out of Washington or even from the White House,\" said Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist poll, referring in particular to the partisan divide. \"There was some confusion initially \u2014 if this was really a health crisis or an economic crisis.\"</p>", "<p>She noted that the differences by party really \"speak to the fact of how we're getting our information.\"</p>", "<p><strong>A lack of faith in the federal government</strong></p>", "<p>Trump's reversal appears warranted, given that Americans' faith in the federal government's response is on the decline.

Again, though, there's a big political divide. Many more Democrats now say the federal government isn't taking adequate steps, going from just 35% in February to 70% now. Independents have also declined in their confidence with just 47% now saying the federal government is doing enough, down from 69%.</p>", "<p>But more than three-quarters (77%) of Republicans say the Trump-led federal government <em>is </em>doing enough, which is actually a slight improvement from February.</p>", "<p>Americans have more faith in their local governments, though, with two-thirds saying their state governments are doing enough.</p>", "<p><em>This survey of 835 adults was conducted Friday and Saturday using live telephone callers via landline and cellphone.

Israel is also banning entry to most foreign visitors and has ordered some 30,000 Israelis into home quarantine. There are around 200 coronavirus cases in the country, most of them mild.</p>", "<p>Netanyahu came under additional criticism for seeking to use surveillance technology to track virus carriers, a move that would impinge on Israelis' privacy.

Americans are hunkering down, professional and college sports have suspended seasons, many states have closed schools. But voting \u2014 at least for now \u2014 continues. And so did the first one-on-one Democratic primary debate of this cycle, albeit in a very different way than originally planned.</p>", "<p>The debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders took place inside a CNN studio in Washington, D.C., rather than before an audience in Arizona, one of the states voting Tuesday in the primaries along with Florida, Ohio and Illinois.</p>", "<p>What to make of the kind of debate that's never been seen before? Here are the takeaways from Sunday night:</p>", "<p><strong>1. Coronavirus dominates </strong></p>", "<p>As to be expected, the novel coronavirus dominated the early part of the debate. The candidates tried to distinguish themselves from President Trump, and it started before the debate even began with an elbow bump between the two men in lieu of a handshake.</p>", "<p>During their answers, Biden displayed a command of the levers of government: saying, for example, that he would deploy the military to address the coronavirus crisis, and explaining how. Sanders, on the other hand, pivoted to talk about the broader ills of the U.S. health care system and tried to promote his \"Medicare for All\" plan.</p>", "<p>Biden pointed out that a single-payer system didn't contain the virus in Italy, which is now on lockdown.</p>", "<p>In the past two weeks, exit polls have shown voters saying they trust Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis. And Biden's interagency expertise played to that strength.</p>", "<p><strong>2. Biden commits to a woman as VP... and other things</strong></p>", "<p>Everyone expected the coronavirus conversation to be the news, and it was. But Biden created a viral moment on a different subject; he declared he would put a woman on the ticket as vice president, if he's the nominee.</p>", "<p>\"There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow,\" Biden said. \"I would pick a woman to be my vice president.\"</p>", "<p>Moderator Dana Bash of CNN followed up to confirm, and Biden said yes, he was committing to putting a woman on the ticket. Sanders hedged a bit, saying that \"in all likelihood\" he would, too, but that he wanted a \"progressive woman.\"</p>", "<p>It was a smart, strategic move by Biden's team, not just to gain attention, but also to help pacify those on the left who have either been slow to warm \u2014 or been outright hostile \u2014 to the former vice president's nomination.</p>", "<p>Reaction from the left on Twitter to his move was probably the best Biden has received the entire campaign. It's all part of his effort to court not just Sanders' supporters, but Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's, too. Also this week, Biden took up Warren's bankruptcy bill plan and endorsed free tuition at state colleges.</p>", "<p>Pointedly, Biden also committed during this debate to putting a black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court; to no new fracking; and to only deporting people in the U.S. illegally who are also felons. That's an olive branch to progressive Latinos, many of whom prefer Sanders and are still smarting at President Barack Obama's high deportation rates.</p>", "<p><strong>3. Their policy differences were obvious, but Biden appeared at times to look past Sanders</strong></p>", "<p>Overall, Biden was steady. He had moments of using impolitic words (like calling people who are in the U.S. illegally \"aliens\" before correcting himself), but Biden mostly appeared in command. It helps when you have a more than 150-delegate lead.</p>", "<p>Because Democrats allocate their delegates proportionally according to the primary vote, that's a very difficult lead for Sanders to overcome, especially as the race heads into states that favor Biden.</p>", "<p>The debate grew acrimonious at times, and Sanders accused Biden of being funded, in part, by the health care industry. But Biden didn't really want to get into it.</p>", "<p>\"I'm not going to get into the back-and-forth about our politics,\" Biden said, looking away from Sanders to the moderators.</p>", "<p>Even Sanders looked like he didn't want to mortally wound Biden.</p>", "<p>\"I know your heart is in the right place,\" Sanders said of Biden at one point.</p>", "<p>Sanders does appear to have a warmth for Biden that he never had for 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton.

Are elections still happening?</strong></p>", "<p>At this point, the answer is yes. But like all of the decision-making around the coronavirus, the situation is fluid and could change.</p>", "<p>The top election officials from the four states voting on Tuesday \u2014 Florida, Illinois, Arizona and Ohio \u2014 released a joint statement last week saying they were moving ahead with their primaries as planned.</p>", "<p>\"Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election,\" the officials said.</p>", "<p>Louisiana, however, became <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815464629/louisiana-postpones-presidential-primary-over-coronavirus-fears?live=1\">the first state</a> to announce it was delaying its primary election, which was scheduled for April 4. The state will now vote on June 20. And Georgia, which was set to vote next Tuesday, on March 24, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/georgia-delays-primary-election-129595\">followed suit</a>. It will now hold its presidential primary on May 19.</p>", "<p><strong>2. How will this affect in-person voting?</strong></p>", "<p>While precincts have had to stock up on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/10/814164951/what-election-officials-are-doing-to-prevent-coronavirus-transmission-while-voti\">hand wipes and disinfectants</a> in the elections that have taken place over the past few weeks, there hasn't been a noticeable decrease in turnout because of fears about the coronavirus. </p>", "<p>That could change Tuesday, said Lori Edwards, the election supervisor for Polk County, Fla.</p>", "<p>Six months ago, Edwards said her office was planning on a turnout rate of 40% to 50% for the primary but is now expecting roughly half that.</p>", "<p>Like <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-coronavirus-primary-election-broward-palm-beach-20200311-x23w7l73njfpvor5t7duzbz6lu-story.html\">other counties</a> in the state, her office has had to deal with poll workers backing out of working the election and has had to move four precincts because the original locations didn't want voters coming in.</p>", "<p>In one instance, Edwards says her office was dropping off voting equipment when the host said, \"Oh no, we don't want those voters here.\"</p>", "<p>More than 30 counties in Ohio have also relocated polling locations, according to the secretary of state's office.</p>", "<p>\"There are moments that you feel as though the floor is crumbling underneath you,\" said Edwards, who has overseen Polk County's elections for 20 years.</p>", "<p>Early in the week, she compared the situation to an election-time hurricane, which officials in the state are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/25/659819848/after-hurricane-michael-voting-is-the-last-thing-on-their-minds\">all too familiar</a> with.</p>", "<p>\"But now I actually think it's worse, because a hurricane hits, you have damage, and then it's over. And then you get to rebuild,\" Edwards said. \"What we're finding in this scenario is that the damage keeps coming.\"</p>", "<p><strong>3. What if I want to vote by mail?</strong></p>", "<p>Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker was one of many state officials last week urging voters to consider voting by mail instead of showing up at the polls.</p>", "<p>\"We encourage voters who choose that option to do so as soon as possible so they can get their vote-by-mail ballots in time to return them by mail by election day,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Mail-in voting, after all, kept Washington's turnout rate above 40% in its primary last week, despite its being among the states hit hardest by the coronavirus and subsequent closures. <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/03/13/coronavirus-could-get-us-to-vote-by-mail\">Advocates</a> say that if the entire country offered some sort of no-excuse mail voting, it would make the democratic process <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/2020-election-coronavirus-bill-vote-by-mail.html\">more resilient</a>.</p>", "<p>\"This [mail] option to vote offers voters more days and more time in a crisis situation, especially when in-person voting may be very limited or very difficult,\" said Amber McReynolds, a former Colorado election official who now runs the nonprofit National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition.</p>", "<p>The reason Pritzker was pressing for urgency, however, is that voters in his state needed to request an absentee ballot by Thursday to be able to vote that way. In Florida and Arizona, the deadline was more than a week ago. In Ohio, it was Friday.</p>", "<p>So voters who were planning to vote in person Tuesday in any of the four states have no other option at this point.</p>", "<p>Voters who already have an absentee ballot in any of those states have until at least Tuesday to get it to their elections office.</p>", "<p>But for those in states that vote in April, there is probably still time to request an absentee ballot.

Americans will be quarantined upon arrival, he said.</p>", "<p>\"You have to have separation, or this thing takes longer to go away,\" he said.</p>", "<p>According to Wolf's statement, U.S. passengers who have been in the affected European nations will be required to travel through \"select airports where the U.S. has implemented enhanced screening procedures.\" Vice President Pence said Thursday there are 13 such airports and added that those travelers who return to the U.S. from the EU will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.</p>", "<p>Pence did not list the airports, but Wolf, in his statement late Wednesday, said DHS will list them in the next 48 hours. </p>", "<p>The administration previously banned travel from China, and during that time travelers from China were <a href=\"http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/Government-Imposed-Travel-Restrictions-OPS-DIS-03/default.aspx\">flown to airports </a>in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Detroit, Newark, N.J., Honolulu, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.</p>", "<p><strong>I am from one of these countries but have a green card.

College students living off-campus may get a door knock starting April 23, instead of April 9, Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR.</p>", "<p>\"It is critical that households understand that self-responding to the census can help alleviate additional burdens to the Bureau, brought on by COVID-19,\" Arturo Vargas, a longtime census advocate and CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, says in a written statement.</p>", "<p>As of Saturday, 3 million households have submitted an online response to <a href=\"https://my2020census.gov/\">my2020census.gov</a> since it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hansilowang/status/1237122157227978753?s=20\">soft-launched on Monday</a>, according to Cook.</p>", "<p>\"The Census Bureau is ready for you to do the same,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the bureau, said in a written statement. \"If you do, there will be no need for census takers to knock on your door.\"</p>", "<p>The Census Bureau has been planning to conduct the national head count through July 31. But this week, some Democratic members of Congress have been calling for the counting to be extended.</p>", "<p>Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Adriano Espaillat \u2014 both of New York \u2014 along with 10 other Congressional Hispanic Caucus members, are <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6810473-March-13-2020-Letter-From-Rep-Adriano-Espaillat.html\">urging the bureau to continue the count for an additional three months</a> through October. A separate group of New York lawmakers led by Rep. Yvette Clarke wants the bureau to extend counting at least through September \"due to the social disruption caused by COVID-19.\"</p>", "<p>\"Social distancing will make enumeration practically impossible during the current allotted time frame,\" Clarke and the other lawmakers wrote in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6809211-March-12-2020-Letter-from-Rep-Yvette-Clarke-to.html\">a letter to Ross</a>.</p>", "<p>In response to the coronavirus, some tribal nations are increasing their security by limiting who can enter tribal territories, according to Lycia Maddocks, vice president of external affairs at the National Congress of American Indians.</p>", "<p>\"Some nations actually have physical guard stands where they can check to see if you're a tribal citizen,\" Maddocks, a citizen of the Quechan Tribe, said during a news conference Friday.</p>", "<p>That could exacerbate the undercount of American Indians and Alaska Natives, who had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6772981-2010-Census-Coverage-Measurement-Estimation-Report.html#document/p5/a549819\">the highest net undercount rate among all racial and ethnic groups in the 2010 census</a>, according to the bureau's estimates. The delivery of census mailings could be delayed and census workers may not be able to travel in Indian Country, where there is often <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/06/673364305/native-americans-on-tribal-land-are-the-least-connected-to-high-speed-internet\">limited or no high-speed Internet service</a>.</p>", "<p>The bureau <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/census-bureau-briefs-congress-on-efforts-to-address-impact-of-coronavirus-on\">told the House Oversight and Reform Committee</a> this week it's watching to see how many households respond on their own before deciding whether to continue counting past July. The bureau <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/statement-coronavirus.html\">has said</a> it is prepared to delay sending out census workers to specific areas where there is an outbreak.</p>", "<p>Still, the bureau is under pressure to meet a critical deadline: <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/13/141\">Under federal law</a>, the Census Bureau is required to deliver the latest population counts of each state to the president by Dec. 31.</p>", "<p>\"If they have to delay too long, then they would have to work with the Congress and see if they would pass a new law to extend the deadline for the census,\" Thompson, the former bureau director, says.</p>", "<p>Asked by NPR on Thursday whether the bureau is considering making such a request to Congress, the bureau's current director, Steven Dillingham, said: \"I wouldn't take anything off the table, but that's the first mention I've heard of that possibility.\"</p>", "<p>The bureau is currently trying to hire and train as many as a half-million census workers to follow up with households that don't fill out a form themselves. These workers are critical to the bureau's strategy for making sure historically undercounted groups \u2014 including communities of color, rural residents and immigrants \u2014 are included in the country's population count.</p>", "<p>\"Historically, Black and Latino households, among others, have lower self-response rates, which means the Census Bureau needs enough manpower in the field to collect census information in-person in these communities,\" Terri Ann Lowenthal, a census consultant who once served as the staff director of the former House oversight subcommittee for the census, says in an email.</p>", "<p>The bureau <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/census-bureau-briefs-congress-on-efforts-to-address-impact-of-coronavirus-on\">told the House Oversight and Reform Committee</a> this week there has not been a significant drop in staffing since the outbreak.</p>", "<p>But Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR that the bureau learned on Friday that the newly hired census field supervisor, who is now quarantined, tested positive for COVID-19. While that employee, who was expected to be based from home, has not engaged with the public on behalf of the bureau, Cooks says the individual interacted with other recently hired census workers and trainers during a new employee training session.</p>", "<p>\"The very limited number of employees with whom the individual was in contact have been notified by public health authorities and are in self-quarantine,\" Cook says in a written statement to NPR. \"We will continue to provide support to any and all impacted employees and follow all public health authority guidance.\"</p>", "<p>Cooks adds the bureau is not aware of any \"work-related public activity\" by the employees in self-quarantine.</p>", "<p>The bureau told lawmakers that it's planning to conduct more online training sessions and give workers safety equipment. Cook tells NPR the bureau is working on including social distancing techniques in trainings for door knockers, known as enumerators, and other on-the-ground census workers. Those who feel sick are \"strongly encouraged\" to stay at home, Cook adds. Enumerators do not get sick leave, but Cook says the bureau is looking into ways to pay them for a work-related injury or illness.</p>", "<p>Still, on Friday, the Commerce Department Office of Inspector General, an internal watchdog group for the bureau, <a href=\"https://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/OIG-20-020-M.pdf\">asked the agency to provide more details by March 20</a> on how it plans to conduct the count at \"a time of unprecedented turmoil and uncertainty.\"</p>", "<p>Thompson, the former bureau director, worries that trying to convince people to work for the census could be a \"particularly sensitive issue,\" especially among retirees over the age of 60. Given the low employment rate, they've been among the groups targeted by the bureau's recruiting efforts. But now they are at higher risk than younger age groups of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.</p>", "<p>Kevin Dowd, 62, a retired accountant who applied for a 2020 census job and lives near Milford, Pa., says he recently decided not to attend a training session for prospective enumerators because he was worried about getting sick.</p>", "<p>\"How many people would be in how big a room?\" Dowd says he wondered. \"Many people have come back from vacation, from places that have more cases, and so I decided that I didn't need the $16 an hour.\"</p>", "<p>The bureau may decide next week to push back its schedule for counting people experiencing homelessness who are staying in shelters, Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR. That count is currently set for March 30 through April 1.</p>", "<p>The agency is also evaluating whether to delay its April 1 count of homeless people living outside of shelters and in public parks, under bridges and other outdoor locations.</p>", "<p>Shelters can choose to have a census worker visit their facility to interview residents and other people who use their services. But rising health concerns about COVID-19 raise two potential challenges, Thompson, the former bureau director, says.</p>", "<p>\"Workers could be reluctant to go to a place where the homeless receive services,\" Thompson says. \"The places could be reluctant to let people in.\"</p>", "<p>Cook says the agency is trying to contact facilities that had planned for an in-person count to ask whether they can switch to paper forms instead.</p>", "<p>In New York City \u2014 home to the country's largest homeless population \u2014 census workers are not expected to visit city-owned shelters because the local department of social services is transferring records about the shelters' residents to the Census Bureau, Julie Menin, the city's census director, tells NPR.</p>", "<p>\"What this really does is ensures that every single homeless person in New York City is properly counted,\" Menin says. \"We don't want anyone to be overlooked. We don't want anyone to be invisible.\"</p>", "<p>Cook says the bureau is trying to encourage 68,000 nursing homes, prisons and other group living facilities, excluding college dorms, to send in information about their residents online or by paper, rather than waiting for a census worker to do in-person interviews starting in early April.</p>", "<p>Close to 12,900 dorms had chosen earlier this year to have the bureau drop off paper forms for each of their student residents to fill out individually. Given the chaotic situation at many campuses, however, the bureau is reaching out to the administrators to see if they want to change those plans.</p>", "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/813750481/more-than-20-colleges-cancel-in-person-classes-in-response-to-coronavirus\">canceling of in-person classes</a> and dorm closures at a growing number of colleges and universities have also raised concerns about whether students who live away from their families' homes will be counted in the right place.</p>", "<p>In general, the bureau says all U.S. residents should be counted where they usually live and sleep, even if they're away on Census Day (April 1). This week, the bureau <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hansilowang/status/1237746334041608194?s=20\">confirmed to NPR</a> that students who have left their college town because of coronavirus should still use their address at school when filling out a census form.</p>", "<p>But it's not clear if that guidance will reach students who have scattered around the country, some scrambling to find last-minute housing. In <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6810492-Census-Bureau-Response-to-Higher-Education.html\">a letter to the Department of Education</a>, the bureau suggests that schools contact their  students who usually live off-campus about how to get counted on their own using <a href=\"https://my2020census.gov/\">my2020census.gov</a>.</p>", "<p>For decades, the bureau has relied on parades, street festivals and worship services as opportunities for local community leaders to encourage participation in the census.</p>", "<p>\"The person-to-person contact can be much more effective than a letter in the mail,\" says Nancy Potok, a former deputy director at the Census Bureau who recently retired as the chief statistician of the U.S.</p>", "<p>But the coronavirus is forcing census advocates to pivot away from in-person outreach activities. John Park, executive director of the MinKwon Center \u2014 a community group based in Queens, N.Y. \u2014 says his organization has been scaling down door-knocking and ramping up texting and phone-banking to encourage households to fill out the census on their own.</p>", "<p>\"We've created multi-lingual T-shirts with QR codes that link to the census self-response URL, which will let people keep their distance but still access the survey,\" Park says in an email.</p>", "<p>Still, for now, the bureau plans to move forward with its outreach efforts through its <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/2020-census-mobile-questionnaire-assistance-operation.pdf\">\"Mobile Questionnaire Assistance\" program</a> after delaying the initial rollout from March 30 to April 6, Cook tells NPR. By April 13, census workers are expected to fan out with computer tablets around the country in areas with low census response rates to help people get counted online.</p>", "<p>While the bureau hopes most households use <a href=\"https://my2020census.gov/\">my2020census.gov</a>, it's still collecting paper questionnaires, which are a critical backstop in case of any major technical breakdowns with the online census form.</p>", "<p>\"One area that people tend to overlook is the importance of the processing centers,\" Potok, the former deputy director of the bureau, says about the two data processing centers in Phoenix and Jeffersonville, Ind., which is across the river from Louisville, Ky., for the 2020 census. \"People need to be there to check in the questionnaires.\"</p>", "<p>The centers can receive, separate and scan as many as 30 million paper questionnaires for the 2020 census, according to <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/planning-docs/PDC_detailed_operational_plan.pdf\">the bureau's plan for its paper data capture operation</a>. Processing those paper forms will help the bureau figure out where they need to send workers to follow up with unresponsive households.</p>", "<p>Deb Stempowski, an assistant director at the bureau who's in charge of operations and schedules for the 2020 census, says if there are any interruptions at one of the sites, the other center could pick up the extra work. Stempowski adds the bureau is tracking paper forms that are mailed back as soon as they enter the mail stream, and the agency is prepared to ask employees to work longer shifts or on the weekends if needed.</p>", "<p>\"I don't believe that we have an issue if we have one or two people who can no longer support the work in one of the centers,\" Stempowski said.</p>", "<p>Still, there is a risk of both facilities having to close because of the coronavirus outbreak.</p>", "<p>The pandemic could also complicate staffing at the call centers that are receiving census responses over the phone and answering questions about the count <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hansilowang/status/1237694757981130752?s=20\">in 13 languages</a>. The 10 census questionnaire assistance centers are located in Tempe, Ariz.; Pueblo, Colo.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Tamarac, Fla.; Kansas City, Mo.; New York City; Blytheville, S.C.; El Paso, Texas; Irving, Texas; and Nashville, Tenn.</p>", "<p>\"We have a significant contingency budget in place, which enables us to move offices if needed,\" Cook tells NPR, referring to a $2 billion budget set aside for 2020 census emergencies.</p>", "<p>If the outbreak ultimately makes it impossible to gather self-reported information from certain households in time, the bureau may have to turn to alternatives to fill in the gaps, including a cache of existing government records from other federal agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Postal Service.</p>", "<p>\"It is possible that administrative records will have to enumerate a much larger share of the population as the virus spreads,\" Kenneth Prewitt, a former Census Bureau director who oversaw the 2000 count, wrote in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/opinion/contributors/census-coronavirus.html\">an op-ed this week in The New York Times</a>.</p>", "<p>Some critics worry that relying on records to complete demographic profiles of certain households may not produce accurate census information.</p>", "<p>\"We find these records work well in matching records for the White and higher-income populations but racial/ethnic minorities, lower-income persons, and other HTC populations are likely to be missed,\" members of a working group of Census Bureau researchers and advisors to the bureau wrote in <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/cac/nac/reports/2016-07-admin_internet-wg-report.pdf\">a 2016 report</a>.</p>", "<p>Before the outbreak, the bureau estimated that about 7.9 million households \u2014 or just over 5% of the around 147 million home addresses it's planning to include in the 2020 census \u2014 will be counted using administrative records, according to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6810491-2020-Census-Supporting-Statement-A-for-OMB.html#document/p10/a556379\">a regulatory document filed in January</a> with the White House's Office of Management and Budget.</p>", "<p>Bureau officials said in the document that if the bureau \"does not have confidence\" in the records for an unresponsive household because of missing or inconsistent data, they plan to continue sending census workers to knock on the door.</p>", "<p>According to <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/planning-docs/NRFU-detailed-operational-plan_v20.pdf\">the bureau's plans</a>, workers are generally supposed to try to gather information in person in up to six days in total. At a time of outbreak, however, it's hard to say how many visits will actually be possible later this year.</p>", "<p></p>", "<p>A previous version of this story said that because of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Census Bureau suggested in a letter that colleges and universities contact their students about how to get counted for the 2020 census online on their own. It would have been more accurate to say that suggestion was in regards only to students who usually live off campus. An earlier version also said that census workers are generally supposed to try to gather information from unresponsive households within six days. It would have been more accurate to say that workers generally have up to six days in total because the days do not have to be in consecutive order.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

After Trump's announcement, the State Department issued <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-3-health-advisory-issue.html\">an advisory</a> informing U.S. citizens to \"reconsider travel abroad\" as a result of outbreaks around the globe.</p>", "<p>Trump also announced economic measures that he said would help the country overcome \"temporary economic disruptions\" caused by the disease.</p>", "<p>The president's prime-time remarks Wednesday cap a concerted effort by the White House to calm a public made jittery by the rapid global spread of the disease and the concomitant economic turmoil.

The recent underdog added that he disagrees that Biden is the stronger candidate to take on President Trump, \"but that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.\"</p>", "<p>To date, the former vice president has won 15 states, while the Vermont senator has won or led the popular vote in eight. Biden currently has a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/799979293/how-many-delegates-do-the-2020-presidential-democratic-candidates-have\">delegate lead</a> of around 150, with a favorable map of states ahead. </p>", "<p>Sanders has acknowledged that the movement he promised to deliver him the nomination is not showing up in big enough numbers. But he's warning Democrats not to write off the strongest parts of his coalition \u2014 young voters and Latinos, particularly emphasizing the former on Wednesday: \"We are winning the generational debate.\"</p>", "<p>\"Today, I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,\" Sanders said. \"And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.\" </p>", "<p>Sanders promised to show up at the debate on Sunday in Arizona to face Biden one-on-one, and basically offered him a cheat sheet: \"Let me be very frank as to the questions that I will be asking Joe.\"</p>", "<p>Sanders listed off issues central to his campaign, which he says are very important to younger progressives: health care costs, climate change, income inequality, student debt, racial disparities in criminal justice, immigration and housing affordability. </p>", "<p>So why tip Biden off to how you're going to challenge him on Sunday? Maybe Bernie Sanders wants Joe Biden to succeed.</p>", "<p>Sanders continues to say that he likes Biden and that defeating Trump is the most important thing this year. Sanders has pledged unequivocally to support his opponent if he himself loses the nomination, something he has done more vigorously and more often than he did in 2016. Despite disparaging the party, and though some of his supporters often get into vitriolic arguments, particularly online, Sanders is clear that he does not want to hand the election to Republicans.</p>", "<p>Given the strong numbers Biden put up with African American voters and white, non-college men in Michigan \u2014 much stronger than Hillary Clinton four years ago \u2014 he would perhaps not need Sanders' movement to overcome the small margins Trump won by in the Midwest. </p>", "<p>But Biden opened the door in his own speech on Tuesday night. </p>", "<p>\"I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal,\" Biden said. \"And together, we'll defeat Donald Trump.\" He then reiterated, \"We'll defeat him together.\"</p>", "<p>And on Wednesday, it seemed as though Sanders was at least in part responding to that call, essentially laying down for Biden a challenge and a road map to secure his support and extend a winning coalition to the left.</p>", "<p>Some of what Sanders dared Biden on wasn't too challenging. He asked Biden, \"Are you really going to veto a 'Medicare for All' bill, if it is passed in Congress?\"</p>", "<p>The qualifier is an easy out for Biden. If Sanders' single-payer, \"Medicare for All\" system passed Congress, that would mean the political winds had shifted dramatically \u2014 that at least some Republicans and moderate Democrats who opposed that plan came on board, because their constituents were also on board. That's an unlikely reality in 2021 if Biden were the new president. </p>", "<p>But on the other issues, Sanders is asking Biden to show at the debate on Sunday that he simply gets the message. And it was telling that Sanders was offering this detailed warning to the Democratic establishment for the future, beyond 2020.</p>", "<p>The Vermont senator \u2014 who remains a registered independent, and who is often accused of wanting to burn the Democratic Party down \u2014 was instead offering advice. Sanders seemed to indicate that as he sees the presidential nomination slipping away, he wants the party to thrive by addressing the issues he cares about the most.</p>", "<p>Sanders is not conceding. He'll be at the next debate and in the next contests. His allies say a good debate and a Biden gaffe could turn the tide, and Biden doesn't yet have even half the delegates he needs to secure the Democratic nomination. </p>", "<p>But given the big losses this week, the question for Sanders had been: What is he going to do? Now he may have put the ball back in Biden's court: If he's running away with the nomination, what is the front-runner going to do if he wants to bring Sanders along and unify the party more quickly?</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

He also seemed to be considering \u2014 in real time \u2014 the logistical details of social distancing, saying, \u201cWhat can stay open and what need be closed?\u201d He finally went back to President Trump, saying he exacerbated this crisis and the larger issues of economic inequality \u2014 and tried to convince voters that he would be the better president to respond to this<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>crisis.</p>", "<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders argued that when Joe Biden was a senator, he argued for significant cuts to Social Security on the Senate floor. Sanders urged viewers to go to YouTube to see Biden\u2019s speech, but Biden flatly denied that he was pushing for<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>cuts.</p>", "<p>Sanders was likely referring to a 1995 speech on the Senate floor when Biden was pushing for a balanced budget<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>amendment.</p>", "<p>\u201cWhen I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well.

Its analysis notes that while Biden has supported cutbacks \u2014 as many Democrats did at various points in proposals to tackle the ballooning deficit \u2014  he has also pushed to increase benefits and worked to eliminate proposals by Republicans to significantly alter the<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>program.</p>", "<p>Biden also argued that any argument that he backed proposals pushed by former GOP Rep Paul Ryan, who proposed broad changes to entitlements, was not<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>true.</p>", "<p>Vermont Sen.

It is making sure we have a progressive woman, and there are progressive women out there. So my very strong tendency is to move in that<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>direction.\u201d</p>", "<p>In a tense back-and-forth between the two candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden accused Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders of being supported by nine superPACs \u2014 a claim that Sanders quickly<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>denied.</p>", "<p>SuperPACs are political groups that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money unconstrained by the contribution limits that apply to candidates\u2019 political campaigns.

But none have spent funds explicitly on Sanders\u2019<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>behalf.</p>", "<p>Sanders criticized Biden for the support he has gotten from the superPAC, Unite the Country, which has backed the former vice president since the fall of 2019. According to Open Secrets, that group has spent over $10 million to support<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>Biden.</p>", "<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden sought to make a bridge to supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign Sunday night.

And I believe the people who support me will do the same thing because the existential threat to the United States of America is Donald Trump,\u201d Biden<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>said.</p>", "<p>The response is yet another example of how Biden has been emphasizing the need to defeat Trump and to unite behind the eventual Democratic<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>nominee.</p>", "<p>Sanders also made clear that if Biden is the nominee, he would support<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>him.</p>", "<p>For his part, Sanders said that he obviously hopes to win the nomination, but that if he doesn\u2019t, he and all of the other Democrats who sought the presidency are prepared \"to come together and do everything humanly possible to defeat Donald<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>Trump.\"</p>", "<p>Moderator Ilia Calder\u00f3n asked Sen. Bernie Sanders about the bailouts Congress passed at the start of the financial crisis to stabilize the banking system. Sanders defended that vote, arguing that taxpayers should have supported what he described as illegal and irresponsible behavior by banks. Former Vice President Joe Biden responded by saying that the bailouts were necessary to prevent a depression and he accused Sanders of voting against the bailouts of automobile<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>companies.</p>", "<p>This dispute over the auto bailouts came up in 2016 also, when Hillary Clinton accused Sanders of being against that package. At the time, <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2016/03/clinton-sanders-bailout-brawl/\">FactCheck.org</a> found that Clinton \u201cstretched the facts\u201d in saying<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>that.</p>", "<p>Sanders did <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00213\">vote against</a> the bill that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which bought toxic assets off of big<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>banks.</p>", "<p>And <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2018/11/13/what-did-america-buy-auto-bailout-and-was-it-worth-it/\">$80 billion in TARP funds</a> did end up being used on auto bailouts. But Sanders had voted to provide other money to the auto manufacturers, as FactCheck pointed<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>out.</p>", "<p>Many Americans were, like Sanders, opposed to the bank bailouts in 2008 \u2014 polling was split, but <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/113047/americans-falling-favor-initial-bailout.aspx\">disfavor grew</a> as 2008 went on. At the time, many were outraged that banks were getting government bailouts after they made risky<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>investments.</p>", "<p>That said, that\u2019s different from whether the bailouts worked. A <a href=\"http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/bank-bailouts\">survey of economists in 2012</a> found that they almost unanimously agreed that the bailouts caused unemployment to be lower at the end of 2010 (when it was still above 9 percent) than it would have been without<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>TARP.</p>", "<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden pushed back at Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 aggressive push for a political revolution to remake the country\u2019s health care<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>system.</p>", "<p>\u201cIf we want a revolution, let\u2019s act now,\u201d Biden said. He insisted that Americans wanted changes to the current Obamacare system, restoring cuts to the program and expanding access. He pointed out that Sanders\u2019 proposals could take four years to put into<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>place.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe can do that now \u2014 I can get that passed. I can get that done as president of the United States,\u201d Biden<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>said.</p>", "<p>Sanders restated that his push for broad changes was essential because of the massive disparity between the wealthiest Americans and the working class and that it was imperative to push for the policy that has become a central plank of his platform  \u2014 \u201cMedicare for<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>All.\u201d</p>", "<p>Sanders said the difference comes down to the \u201cpower structure\u201d and suggested Biden shouldn\u2019t be taking contributions from Wall<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>Street.</p>", "<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders clashed over campaign finance issues, with Sanders opening the round by criticizing Biden for taking contributions from people in the fossil fuel and health insurance industries, among<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>others.</p>", "<p>Biden retorted by asking Sanders to join him in pushing for federally funded elections, something he says he first proposed three decades<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>ago.</p>", "<p>Biden touted his small-dollar donations, adding he hasn\u2019t gotten any single contribution over $2,800, which is the federal limit for any one individual\u2019s gift per election cycle. (Sanders has long led Democratic candidates in fundraising from small-dollar<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>donors.)</p>", "<p>The two then clashed over superPACs, which can raise and spend much more money on behalf of a candidate and must operate independently of the candidate\u2019s<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>campaign.</p>", "<p>Sanders asked Biden to condemn the superPAC that\u2019s supporting the former vice president and, Sanders says, running attack ads against him. Biden said the same of the nine superPACs he said that support Sanders. Sanders denied there are nine superPACs backing his<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>campaign.</p>", "<p>Both candidates were asked by Univision anchor Ilia Calder\u00f3n how they would ensure that immigrants would feel safe enough to seek treatment for<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>COVID-19.</p>", "<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would make sure no one faces deportation for seeking care, \u201cperiod.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders pointed out that under \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d undocumented people are covered and that it\u2019s important \u201cto make sure that everybody feels comfortable getting the health care that they need \u2014 that should be a general principle, above and beyond the<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>coronavirus.\u201d</p>", "<p>The issue of how undocumented immigrants will cope during the coronavirus crisis is potentially a major one. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.keranews.org/post/immigrant-families-suffer-health-impacts-many-fear-new-public-charge-rule\">already evidence</a> that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule that connects people\u2019s use of safety net programs with their prospects for legally immigrating is affecting the use of medical services \u2014 even for services and populations that fall outside the reach of the<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>rule.</p>", "<p>The success of the American effort to keep ahead of the spread of coronavirus will <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/02/27/810129440/public-trust-is-critical-in-health-crises-is-the-trump-administration-losing-it\">depend on public trust</a>. There is such deep distrust already \u2014 and fear \u2014 among the estimated 11 million people in the country who are undocumented. Whether we create a system to treat people with COVID-19 that is easy to access \u2014 and that people have trust they can access safely \u2014 could have a major impact on how we fare as a<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>country.</p>", "<p>Moderator Ilia Calder\u00f3n asked former Vice President Joe Biden about why he, this week, decided to get behind an Elizabeth Warren-backed plan to repeal a bankruptcy bill that she and Biden clashed over when it passed in<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>2005.</p>", "<p>As I <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/06/11/731370440/democratic-presidential-debates-could-reignite-warren-biden-bankruptcy-fight\">wrote last year</a>, the bill responded to a rise in bankruptcies and instituted a number of changes to bankruptcy<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>law:</p>", "<p>\u201cThe 2005 bill restricted who could discharge their debts via Chapter 7 bankruptcy and also made the process more difficult. It included a means test, in the form of comparing a person\u2019s income with their state\u2019s median income. The goal, proponents argued, was to make sure that people who could still pay their debts weren\u2019t able to unfairly escape their debts, while also ensuring that people who couldn\u2019t pay were able to get<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>relief.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe bill also said that a person had to go through credit counseling before obtaining<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>bankruptcy.\u201d</p>", "<p>Warren \u2014 then a Harvard professor \u2014 and Biden had clashed over the law for years. She and some congressional Democrats thought the bill would enrich credit card companies (some of which were based in Biden\u2019s home state of Delaware) and hurt consumers. Warren particularly worried that it would hurt<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>women.</p>", "<p>At Sunday night\u2019s debate, Biden defended his support for that bill, saying it would have been worse for consumers had he not been<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>involved.</p>", "<p>The fact that Biden now backs this plan is seen as an olive branch to progressives who once backed Warren\u2019s presidential bid or who currently back Sen. Bernie Sanders. In addition to making filing for bankruptcy easier, repealing the bill would also allow people to discharge their student loans via bankruptcy \u2014 something that is very difficult to do right<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>now.</p>", "<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden were each asked what steps they were taking as the coronavirus has upended the presidential campaign. The virus has prompted both men to ask their staff to work from home. Their campaigns have also canceled in-person rallies and town halls alike. Instead, both Biden and Sanders are turning to virtual<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>events.</p>", "<p>When the two men started the debate, there was no traditional handshake, they bumped elbows<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>instead.</p>", "<p>For his part, Sanders said he\u2019s using a lot of soap and hand sanitizer. Biden said he washes his hands \"God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap,\" and avoids touching his<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>face.</p>", "<p>There has never been a debate like this. It was moved into a TV studio, as the country has essentially ground to a halt because of the novel coronavirus. But there\u2019s still politics at play and a primary to win. After all, four big states, including Florida and Ohio, vote<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>Tuesday.</p>", "<p>But during this debate, instead of trying to draw contrasts, former Vice President Joe Biden seems to be looking past his immediate opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders promoted his \u201cMedicare For All\u201d plan as a bigger-picture point in responding not just to coronavirus but also to the broader holes in the health insurance<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>industry.</p>", "<p>Biden dismissed that, saying a single-payer system didn\u2019t work in Italy to prevent the spread of that coronavirus. Biden instead wanted to talk about how to deal with the national<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>emergency.</p>", "<p>Sanders attacked Biden for aspects of the health care industry funding Biden\u2019s campaign. Biden reacted quickly and shot a look at Sanders, but Biden declined to shoot back. Instead, Biden, who has about a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/799979293/how-many-delegates-do-the-2020-presidential-democratic-candidates-have\">154-delegate lead</a>, said, he\u2019s \u201cnot going to get into the back-and-forth about our<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>politics.\u201d</p>", "<p>Overall, Biden is trying to look like a leader in a crisis. Sanders brought it back to his platform and the larger ills of American society, as he sees<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>it.</p>", "<p>Responding to a moderator\u2019s question, former Vice President Joe Biden was unequivocal that he \u201cwould call out the military \u2014 now\u201d to assist in the coronavirus response, were he<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>president.</p>", "<p>\u201cThey have the capacity to provide this surge help that hospitals need,\u201d he said, then cited how the military assisted with the response to the Ebola crisis when he was vice president in the Obama<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>administration.</p>", "<p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t engage as directly with the question, saying: \u201cI think we use all of the tools that make sense.\u201d He said if that includes calling up the National Guard, then yes, it\u2019s a good option. Sanders then pivoted to more familiar terrain for him: how he would help workers affected by what is expected to be an economic<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>downturn.</p>", "<p>Just Sunday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-trump.html\">called on</a> President Trump to \u201ctask the Army Corps of Engineers to expand hospital<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>capacity.\u201d</p>", "<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders connected coronavirus to his signature \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan several times over the past week, and he did again Sunday night. He said that as president, he would want to be able to say, \u201cPeople of America, do not worry about the cost of prescription drugs, do not worry about the cost of the health care you\u2019re going to<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>get.\u201d</p>", "<p>Sanders\u2019 proposed single-payer system would offer government-administered insurance to all Americans. He has multiple times over the past week <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/lessons-coronavirus-bernie-sanders-addresses-nation/\">connected coronavirus</a> to his hope that the U.S. could pass single-payer health care, arguing that everyone needs to be insured to keep everyone<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>healthy.</p>", "<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden pointed out that deaths are on the rise in Italy, which has its own form of single-payer health<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>care.</p>", "<p>\u201cWith all due respect to Medicare for All, you have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn\u2019t work there,\u201d Biden said. Biden supports a health care overhaul in the form of a public option. He also argued that during the coronavirus outbreak, health care should be made available to all even without a Medicare for All<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>system.</p>", "<p>Not surprising that we\u2019re starting with addressing the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 it\u2019s hard to think about anything else right now. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s first response ticked through ideas that he outlined last week in his coronavirus speech; Sen. Bernie Sanders zeroed in on the need for people to not worry about payment for testing and<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>treatment.</p>", "<p>There have been a range of efforts to anticipate and assuage the financial concerns of the many millions of underinsured and uninsured people across the country who might get sick with COVID-19. But the system is so fragmented that it\u2019s confusing whether the promises from the federal government and private insurers will be enough. When cases surge \u2014 as they\u2019re expected to in the coming days \u2014 we\u2019ll start to see whether it\u2019s<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>enough.</p>", "<p>Sunday night\u2019s debate features a change in moderators. Initially, Jorge Ramos of Univision was set to serve alongside CNN anchors Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. But Ramos relinquished his spot as a precaution after he said he had possibly been exposed to the coronavirus, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniNoticias/status/1238148732253806593\">Univision said late last<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>week</a>.</p>", "<p>In a statement, the Democratic National Committee said that both Ramos and the person he was in contact with are in good health and symptom-free and that Ramos had been cleared by medical professionals. He stepped aside out of an abundance of caution. Univision anchor Ilia Calder\u00f3n is moderating the debate in Ramos\u2019s<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>place.</p>", "<p>The Democratic presidential debate between Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden began with an elbow bump instead of the traditional<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>handshake.</p>", "<p>Before the two candidates greeted each other they walked out to lecterns set 6 feet apart, which reflected guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for \u201csocial<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>distancing.\u201d</p>", "<p>Sunday night\u2019s CNN-Univision debate moved from a debate hall in Arizona with a live audience to a television studio in CNN\u2019s Washington bureau.

We piled into her pick-up and rode along for the last of her day's chores, watching her toss fistfuls of hay across a field for her cattle. We had come to visit Proffitt, a 47-year-old registered independent as part of NPR's election series <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/804658686/where-voters-are\">Where Voters Are.</a> Her countryside community, like many rural communities across America<a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/upshot/election-2016-voting-precinct-maps.html*9.00/35.245/-81.341/41565__;Iw!!Iwwt!FagG4bHAuz8qqlH-NpJ0pXYG4TYHtVAq6HUGw5yAnp89rQQdRp9ViwQmKc75rg%24\">, has voted differently</a> from its neighboring big city of Charlotte in recent years, and we wanted to understand what has driven that chasm.</p>", "<p>\n                Having spent time in the city and the countryside, Proffitt says she is keenly aware of how the two communities perceive each other.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Arezou Rezvani/NPR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Having spent time in the city and the countryside, Proffitt says she is keenly aware of how the two communities perceive each other.</p>", "<p>Proffitt was able to give us a clear-eyed view of the divide because she used to live on the other side of it. Prior to moving to Kings Mountain 12 years ago, she lived in several big cities <strong>-- </strong> Boulder, Colo., Seattle, Park City, Utah, and nearby Charlotte. She had worked as a school teacher, but these days, she raises cattle that is slaughtered and sold as beef to locals and at a farmer's market in Charlotte. She says the lower cost of living and slower pace drew her to the more rural area where she also had family.</p>", "<p>She's a regular at Linwood, a charming cash-only mom-and-pop restaurant with hand-written menus. A bulky TV by the register, adorned with a hundred-dollar-bill sticker featuring Trump on its flickery screen, carries Fox News all day long as diners fuel up on hamburger steaks, flounder, slaw and fresh apple dumplings. </p>", "<p>Proffitt says she was most interested in Mike Bloomberg at the time of this interview \u2014 but says she'll now support whoever the Democratic nominee is.</p>", "<p>Having spent time in the city and the countryside, Proffitt is keenly aware of how the two communities perceive each other. \"I think there's definitely a misconception that rural people are stupid or dumb, that we're uneducated. There's plenty of people who have college degrees here,\" says Proffitt, who blames the media and pop culture for that perception. \"Southerners as a whole and rural people have been presented on television and media as being idiots and maybe ignorant and not as articulate.\"</p>", "<p>That judgement cuts both ways. Proffitt says rural communities can see their urban neighbors as \"being out of touch with reality, not really understanding what's going on outside of those city walls. I think they see it as more of a rat race and, keeping up with the Joneses sort of mentality, whereas in a rural area, they're focused more on the simple things in life.\"</p>", "<p>The same day we visited Proffitt at the far edge of metro Charlotte, our colleague <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/811504602/the-deep-divide-between-urban-and-rural-voters\">Sarah McCammon met a group of voters</a> in Charlotte's liberal city center. Voters there told her they feel marginalized by the president's policies and can't understand how his supporters can defend his views and actions.  \"A lot of people just aren't educated,\" says Collette Alston, president of the African-American Caucus for the Democratic Party. \"A lot of people are voting on emotion and fear.\"</p>", "<p>People who live in different parts of the same Charlotte metro area consistently described feeling a world apart from their neighbors. </p>", "<p>Proffitt says there's only one way to bridge the divide \u2014 to walk across it. To her rural neighbors \u2014 \"spend a week in Charlotte and go out to dinner and see that you can walk down the street and not be shot. You can survive in that world,\" says Proffitt. \"And it's the same thing with Charlotte folks. Come out. This is a good life, too, and it's a respectable life. Only way to fix it is to experience it.\"</p>", "<p>However disconnected people may feel in and around Charlotte, Proffitt's life illustrates the way urban and rural areas are actually intertwined. Without her family farm, people in Charlotte would have less to eat, and without Charlotte's economic growth and tax revenue, the surrounding countryside would be a lot less prosperous.</p>", "<p>Kings Mountain and Charlotte are part of one metro area, though like many cities and their surrounding countryside towns across the country, that may not prevent those areas from making very different choices at the polls again this November.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Biden's clear path to the nomination</strong></p>", "<p>Biden won Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho. Sanders took the North Dakota caucuses, and as of Wednesday afternoon, Washington was still too close to call.</p>", "<p>Biden extended his delegate lead to 160, a lead that will be difficult for Sanders to overcome because of the proportional way Democrats allocate their delegates \u2014 there are no winner-take-all states \u2014 and because many of the upcoming primaries favor Biden.</p>", "<p>Next week, for example, 577 delegates are at stake in Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Arizona. Florida is the biggest prize, with 219 delegates. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won Florida overwhelmingly over Sanders.</p>", "<p class=\"credit\"><span class=\"credit_label\">Credit: </span> NPR</p>", "<p>The state has an older electorate compared with the country as a whole; African Americans constitute a significant proportion of the vote; and the under-30 demographic is less than 10% of the electorate. None of that bodes well for Sanders.</p>", "<p>Following those four primaries, Georgia votes on March 24. Given that a sizable share of the electorate \u2014 51% in 2016 \u2014 is African American, Biden would appear to be the favorite.</p>", "<p>On April 4, it's a similar story with Louisiana, which has the biggest share of delegates that day. Alaska and Hawaii also hold primaries and Wyoming has its caucuses.</p>", "<p>Wisconsin follows on April 7. Sanders scored a lopsided win there over Clinton in 2016. But even if Sanders repeats, Biden would still get a significant share of Wisconsin's 84 delegates.</p>", "<p>Then comes April 28, a big day with 663 delegates at stake in six states. A lot of them are mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states that may lean Biden's direction  \u2014 Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania, for example. New York is the biggest prize that day, but even if Sanders wins it, if he's not rolling into that day with victories elsewhere, he won't be able to net the delegates he needs for the nomination.</p>", "<p>\"The math says Joe is our prohibitive nominee,\" declared former Democratic rival Andrew Yang on CNN, who made MATH (Make America Think Harder) a staple of his campaign. Yang endorsed Biden on Tuesday night.</p>", "<p>Guy Cecil, who runs Priorities USA, a super PAC that has pledged to spend $150 million to help the Democratic nominee, echoed that.</p>", "<p>\"What tonight has made clear is that the delegate math is now a straight line to Joe Biden's nomination,\" Cecil <a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/liveblogs/20200310-primaries/share/guy-cecil-71.html\">said during NPR's live coverage</a>.</p>", "<p><strong>2. But does that mean the nomination fight should be shut down?</strong></p>", "<p>Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a key Biden supporter, had called for the nominating race to end if Sanders didn't win a state Tuesday night.</p>", "<p>\"I think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,\" Clyburn said, \"and quite frankly, if the night ends the way it has begun, I think it is time for us to shut this primary down, it is time for us to cancel the rest of these debates \u2014 because you don't do anything but get yourself in trouble if you continue in this contest when it's obvious that the numbers will not shake out for you.\"</p>", "<p>Sanders supporters did not take kindly to that message. And it's an especially provocative one given that Sanders, who didn't speak Tuesday night, is undoubtedly trying to figure out his path forward.</p>", "<p>For what it's worth, Biden took a different approach.</p>", "<p>\"I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,\" Biden said during his speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday night. \"We share a common goal, and, together, we'll defeat Donald Trump.\"</p>", "<p><strong>3. Biden needs Sanders' supporters</strong></p>", "<p>If Biden does become the nominee, he's going to need Sanders' voters, especially the young.</p>", "<p>Democratic-leaning voters under 30 continue to favor Sanders. In Michigan and Missouri, for example, Biden lost young voters by 57 and 45 percentage points, respectively. And that's similar to what we saw in other states.</p>", "<p>But a general election is different from a primary. Young Sanders voters may well be motivated to vote for Biden in a matchup with Trump. The 2016 election was decided by fewer than 100,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Democrats will need everyone reading from the same playbook.</p>", "<p><strong>4. White women</strong> <strong>continue to be a crucial group</strong></p>", "<p>Biden has been winning huge margins with African American voters, older voters and moderates. But we noted before Tuesday that white women might be the swing group to watch, especially in Michigan, and that they could determine the outcome.</p>", "<p>In Tuesday's primary, that's exactly what happened.</p>", "<p>Sanders won white women in Michigan in 2016, but Biden won them by double digits Tuesday night. This group of voters, especially in the suburbs, is what fueled Democrats' flipping the House in 2018.</p>", "<p>They will be a crucial group again in the fall.</p>", "<p><strong>5. Beating Trump was more important than public policy</strong></p>", "<p>Democratic primary voters continue to say that health care is the most important issue for them. And big majorities are saying that they support replacing private health insurance with a government plan.</p>", "<p>That would appear to benefit Sanders. Even in Michigan, 57% support the idea.</p>", "<p>But what turned out to be the overriding issue for Democratic voters was the amorphous quality of \"electability.\" In Michigan, 58% said picking a candidate who could beat Trump was more important than picking one who agreed with them on most issues.</p>", "<p>And of those who said beating Trump was most important, Biden won <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/michigan-results\">62%</a>.</p>", "<p><strong>6. Coronavirus is on the minds of voters and campaigns \u2013 and so is leadership</strong></p>", "<p>Sanders and Biden canceled rallies in Ohio because of the risk of coronavirus transmission. And the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the next debate, which takes place Sunday in Phoenix, without a live audience.</p>", "<p>\"At the request of both campaigns and out of an abundance of caution,\" the DNC said in a statement, \"there will be no live audience at the Arizona debate taking place on Sunday, March 15th.\"</p>", "<p>Voters said Tuesday, according to the exit polls, that coronavirus was important to their vote. Biden won those voters \u2014 and voters also said he's best to handle a major crisis.</p>", "<p>In Washington state, which has been hit hard by novel coronavirus, 81% of voters said they were concerned about it. Asked who was best to handle a crisis, Washington voters said Biden 44% to 27% over Sanders.</p>", "<p>It was a similar story in Michigan and Missouri. In Michigan, it was Biden 50% to 31% over Sanders, and in Missouri, it was Biden 61% to 26%.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Now former Vice President Joe Biden has consolidated support so rapidly, and won so many states, that Sanders is facing calls to drop out of the race. </p>", "<p>But Sanders announced his intention to press on in a statement on Wednesday.</p>", "<p>\"Donald Trump is the most dangerous president in the modern history of our country, and he must be defeated,\" Sanders said. \"I will do everything in my power to make that happen.\"</p>", "<p>Sanders conceded, however, that last night was poor for his campaign \"from a delegate point of view,\" as Biden <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/799979293/how-many-delegates-do-the-2020-presidential-democratic-candidates-have\">expanded his lead</a> in the race.</p>", "<p>Sanders pointed ahead to Sunday's one-on-one debate with Biden in Arizona, and he said he would work to change the minds of voters who say they like his policy ideas but view Biden as the best option to defeat Trump in November. </p>", "<p>\"The American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal,\" Sanders said.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/YtsFCyqD-HWSueGzu.html\">Watch his remarks here</a>.</p>", "<p><strong>A shift in tone</strong></p>", "<p>Ahead of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Sanders would often end his rallies with a bold prediction: A wave of record turnout was on its way, and young and first-time voters would pave the way for a Sanders win that would shake the political establishment.</p>", "<p>The wave never came, even as Sanders won two of the first three contests and finished in a virtual tie for first in the other. Exit poll after exit poll showed that while Sanders was winning young voters by a large margin, youth turnout was either flat or down in many states.</p>", "<p>On Sunday evening, Sanders found himself in a familiar setting: addressing more than 10,000 amped-up young people on a college campus. But Sanders ended that Ann Arbor, Mich., rally on a different tone \u2014 more of a plea than a boast. </p>", "<p>\"We need you to come out to vote, or to vote early,\" he said. \"We need you to bring out your friends and families and coworkers.</p>", "<p>\"Tell your friends that you're tired of them complaining about high tuition and student debt and lack of health care and low wages and unaffordable housing. Tell them to stop complaining and to stand up and fight back.\"</p>", "<p>They didn't \u2014 at least in big enough numbers to help Sanders. He lost Michigan, a state that delivered him his biggest upset win of the 2016 primary, by more than 10 points, despite winning the 18- to 29-year-old demographic by more than 50 percentage points, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/michigan/democratic\">CNN exit polls</a>.</p>", "<p>On Wednesday, Sanders warned the Democratic Party against nominating someone who young people do not support.</p>", "<p>\"We are winning the generational debate,\" Sanders said. \"Today I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country.

Sanders ratcheted up attacks on Biden's support for trade deals like NAFTA, and for the 2003 Iraq War. </p>", "<p>But on Super Tuesday, and again this Tuesday night, a clear pattern emerged: In state after state this month, Democratic voters have weighed that binary choice and picked Biden. </p>", "<p><strong>The math leading to November</strong></p>", "<p>Even as Sanders weighs his future, many Democratic leaders are viewing Biden as the party's likely, if not mathematically prohibitive, nominee.</p>", "<p>Shortly after Biden was projected the winner in Michigan, Guy Cecil, chairman of the powerful Priorities USA superPAC, threw his support behind the former vice president.</p>", "<p>\"What tonight has made clear is that the delegate math is now a straight line to Joe Biden's nomination,\" Cecil told NPR. \"So we're going to do everything we can to help him in the effort looking forward to November.\"</p>", "<p>The super PAC is already up with online ads in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida and plans to start television ads in Michigan on Wednesday, Cecil said. The group plans to focus on countering President Trump's economic message, fighting against attacks on Biden.</p>", "<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The math is now clear.

I hope others will join us in the fight.</p>", "<p>Priorities USA has announced plans to spend $150 million on online and television advertising before the Democratic Party's convention in July. The group's advertising support clears the way for Biden to invest his official campaign cash on other priorities.</p>", "<p>The move was largely symbolic as Sanders has long rejected the financial backing of super PACs. But the announcement means Biden will have critical spending support going forward.</p>", "<p>Some Biden supporters, including Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., were calling for Sanders to step aside before the polls closed in Michigan. Clyburn said it is in the party's best interest to consolidate quickly and focus energy on defeating Trump.</p>", "<p>\"I think it is time for us to shut this primary down.

That endorsement helped jump-start momentum for Biden after disappointing finishes in the first three contests.</p>", "<p><strong>\"Their ideas need to be embraced\"</strong></p>", "<p>Not all Democrats share his confidence. Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, who has not endorsed a candidate, urged the party to allow voters to decide. Dingell told NPR that Democrats should not force anyone out of the race, particularly when young voters in her state are turning out strongly for Sanders.</p>", "<p>\"You don't shut that off. You need everybody engaged,\" Dingell told NPR. \"You don't tell somebody they need to get out.\"</p>", "<p>Sanders supporter Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also warned against alienating voters who have been energized by Sanders. She pointed to the coalition of progressives, young voters and Latinos who have backed Sanders in large numbers.</p>", "<p>\"I don't think we can gloss over the generational divide,\" Jayapal told NPR. \"Their ideas need to be embraced, and we need to build an enthusiasm so people vote not only from fear, but also from hope.\"</p>", "<p>They would also need to turn out in November for Democrats to defeat Trump.</p>", "<p>In 2016, Sanders pressed on through the full primary calendar, even when it was clear that Clinton wouldn't relinquish her delegate lead. Despite the fact that Sanders campaigned for Clinton in the general election, many Democrats think Sanders' extended campaign weakened Clinton's candidacy.</p>", "<p>Sanders has repeatedly pledged to do everything he can to defeat Trump, and, if he isn't the nominee, to fully back Biden.</p>", "<p>The question Sanders and his advisers face in Burlington, Vt., after another week of lopsided losses: whether there's any plausible path forward for the political revolution they were all so sure about just a few weeks ago.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Not only did he defeat Sanders by 16.5 points, but he did so among an energized Democratic electorate: With 100% of precincts reporting, turnout in Michigan was above 1.5 million, compared to the roughly 1.2 million who voted in 2016.</p>", "<p>Biden improved upon Clinton's 2016 Michigan showing across a variety of demographic groups \u2014 meaning that in a mostly two-person race, Sanders' performance worsened among these groups. </p>", "<p>While men <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/primaries/polls/mi/Dem\">preferred Sanders</a> by 10 points then, they were roughly evenly split between Biden and Sanders on Tuesday.

Four years ago, white voters preferred Sanders by 14 points. This year, they preferred Biden by 11 points.</p>", "<p>These shifts raise questions about what motivated voters this year, with a self-proclaimed democratic socialist once again running against a more-moderate, establishment Democrat. While it's true that electability is playing a major role in this year's race, the results also raise the question of how much votes for Sanders in 2016 were votes <em>against </em>Clinton (and to what degree gender may have played into that).</p>", "<p><strong>2) Voters saw Biden as the best in a crisis</strong></p>", "<p>Against the backdrop of an escalating coronavirus outbreak, Biden came out ahead of Sanders on the question of who would be better in a crisis.</p>", "<p>About half of Michigan voters said they thought Biden was best equipped to handle a crisis, compared to about 31% who sided with Sanders. In Missouri, Biden edged Sanders 61% to 26% on the question. </p>", "<p>As coronavirus spreads \u2014 and concerns over the outbreak spread even faster \u2014  that question about crisis-handling may have been particularly relevant to voters. </p>", "<p>Indeed, in Washington, the state with the most coronavirus cases and deaths, Biden performed <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/washington-results?icid=election_nav\">substantially better</a> (41%) than Sanders (24%) among voters who said they were \"very concerned\" about the coronavirus. </p>", "<p>One additional point about Washington's exit polls: Because of mail-in voting, many people voted when the field was much bigger. That means the polls show significant support for Warren and Bloomberg, who have both dropped out.</p>", "<p><strong>3) Young voters haven't turned out to boost Sanders</strong></p>", "<p>Sanders <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/06/812486517/bernie-sanders-call-for-young-voters-isn-t-working-out-the-way-he-planned\">acknowledged</a> after Super Tuesday that he hadn't succeeded at bringing out enough of the young voters who tend to support him.</p>", "<p>On Tuesday, that trend continued. In Missouri four years ago, voters under 30 made up 16% of the Democratic primary electorate. This year, they made up 14%.</p>", "<p>There's a similar pattern in Michigan: In 2016, those young voters made up 19% of the electorate, compared to 16% this year. Thirteen percent of Mississippi's voters were under 30 this year, compared to 15% in the state's last Democratic primary.

In all others, that share has held steady or dropped. NBC's Steve Kornacki rounded up those numbers this week:</p>", "<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2016 vs. 2020: Share of Dem primary/caucus electorate under 30<br><br>IA 18% ('16) =&gt; 24% ('20)<br>NH 19% =&gt; 13%<br>NV 18% =&gt; 17%<br>SC 15% =&gt; 11%<br>AL 14% =&gt; 10%<br>MA 19% =&gt; 16%<br>NC 18% =&gt; 14%<br>TN 15% =&gt; 11%<br>TX 20% =&gt; 15%<br>VA 16% =&gt; 13%<br>VT 15% =&gt; 11%</p>", "<p>It's true that the <em>raw number</em> of young voters may be up in some states, particularly those where total turnout has gone up. However, they have not turned out in big enough numbers to shift the composition of the electorate. </p>", "<p>That is bad news for Sanders, who does much better among young voters than older voters. He won more than 7 in 10 voters under 30 in Michigan and Missouri alike.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, older voters <em>really</em> like Biden. Seven in 10 voters over 65 in Michigan said they voted for him, along with 8 in 10 in Missouri and 9 in 10 in Mississippi.

They saw both Warren and her fellow presidential candidate Bernie Sanders as allies for their causes.</p>", "<p>Sanders had inherited goodwill from his 2016 run against Hillary Clinton. But Warren was the charismatic star on late night TV who had fought the big banks during the recession and, notably, was the politician progressives had initially tried to draft into the 2016 primary as an opponent to Clinton before Sanders entered the race.</p>", "<p>\"Our members really wanted to see her run in that race,\" explained Charles Chamberlain, chair of Democracy for America, one of the organizations that had helped spearhead the \"Run, Warren, Run\" movement in 2015. \"We believed that she would have been a better candidate than Hillary Clinton.\"</p>", "<p>Last week, Democracy for America endorsed Sanders over Warren.</p>", "<p>Chamberlain said the major change in the interim years was Sanders' presidential bid in 2016.</p>", "<p>\"Bernie Sanders ran \u2014 in 2016 \u2014 an incredible campaign that won 23 contests, changed the narrative in this country about what is possible for progressives, and even moved the entire Democratic Party to the left,\" he said.</p>", "<p>For much of the primary season, Chamberlain said, the group's members were split, but as it became clear that Sanders was winning races and Warren couldn't finish higher than third place, they decided to publicly back the Vermont senator.</p>", "<p>\"The guiding principle among our members was, who is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump and who can win?\" Chamberlain said.</p>", "<p>The story of how and why the woman who was once lauded as the great progressive political hope lost the backing of a number of leading progressive groups explains part of why Warren's campaign failed.</p>", "<p>If Sanders had not run this year, they agree, they would have wholeheartedly backed Warren. Some groups made a point of insisting their endorsements were not because of anything Warren said or did, but because of Sanders' credibility and consistency on issues like health care and climate change. They bristle at the suggestion of a single moment that led to their decisions, but they acknowledge a turning point that began in October when freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Sanders. The Vermont senator's support then accelerated into the winter as Warren was seen as backpedaling on a core issue \u2014 Medicare for All.</p>", "<p><strong>A message: Don't stay neutral</strong></p>", "<p>The first major progressive group to make an endorsement was the Working Families Party in September, and it chose Warren.</p>", "<p>\"Elizabeth Warren has been a personal hero to many WFP members,\" the group's national director, Maurice Mitchell, said to an estimated 20,000-person crowd at a rally in New York City. \"Her critique of the financial industry helped lay the groundwork for Occupy Wall Street.\"</p>", "<p>The Working Families Party's decision sent a message to fellow progressives: Don't stay neutral in the primary; pick a side.</p>", "<p>At the time, Warren was rising in the polls, and for a sliver of time, she even overtook Joe Biden as the national front-runner. So, it seemed that both progressive organizations and voters would be split between Warren and Sanders.</p>", "<p>But, ultimately, that's not what happened.</p>", "<p><strong>\"You started to see dominoes fall\"</strong></p>", "<p>In October, three of the four members of the so-called congressional \"squad\" of progressives \u2014 Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar \u2014 decided to back Sanders in quick succession.

The organization endorsed Sanders in December.</p>", "<p>Also in December, the Center for Popular Democracy Action, another progressive coalition, backed Sanders. And then in January, the Sunrise Movement, a group of thousands of young climate activists, publicly backed Sanders.</p>", "<p>They all pointed to the Vermont senator's authenticity plus the unparalleled time and access he gave them. But some of them also acknowledged a concern many Democrats have alluded to this cycle \u2014 electability.</p>", "<p>\"A lot of us believe Sen. Sanders is uniquely capable of winning and beating Trump,\" said Goehl.</p>", "<p><strong>The battle to out-progressive Sanders</strong></p>", "<p>Warren fans often praised her trademark plans and her focus on policy. But when it came to ideology, Sanders took those ideas further. Warren promised a <a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/toolkit/umt\">2-cent wealth tax</a> on people with a net worth over $50 million. Sanders upped her, and called for a <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/\">1% wealth tax</a> on net worth above $32 million. Warren promised <a href=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-for-universal-child-care-762535e6c20a\">affordable child care</a>.

And that was a distinction many progressives noticed.</p>", "<p>October was a tough month for Warren. She was repeatedly questioned by journalists and her opponents over the details of how she would pay for Medicare for All without raising middle-class taxes. On Nov. 1, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775335150/read-elizabeth-warrens-plan-to-pay-for-medicare-for-all\">she put out a plan</a>, but the more details she offered, the more compromising she appeared to progressive purists.</p>", "<p>\"Her sort of distancing herself from Medicare for All and when she thought she would be able to get it done \u2014 really, you know, distanced her from our folks,\" said Natalia Salgado, political director with the Center for Popular Democracy Action.</p>", "<p>One progressive activist whom NPR spoke with for this story is backing Sanders but acknowledged that Warren's two-step plan on Medicare for All was the more realistic way to achieve universal coverage. Still, he said, she shouldn't have compromised at the outset, because Republicans would chip away at it further. Democrats, he insisted, needed to be bold and uncompromising.</p>", "<p>There was another key issue for progressives \u2014 immigration.

Bernie Sanders after Massachusetts Sen. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/05/805052138/sen-elizabeth-warren-drops-out-of-the-2020-presidential-race\">Elizabeth Warren</a> and former New York City Mayor <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811873643/after-disappointing-super-tuesday-mike-bloomberg-suspends-his-campaign\">Mike Bloomberg</a> dropped out. (Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is still in the race but has won only two delegates.)</p>", "<p>For Sanders to reclaim the momentum, all eyes are on Michigan on Tuesday. It's a state Sanders narrowly won in 2016. If he wins it this time, it could reshape the race yet again. If he loses, there will be few opportunities for him to change the trajectory of this nominating contest, especially with states ahead that appear to favor Biden.</p>", "<p>What we're calling \"Big Tuesday\" offers 352 delegates among six states. That's about a quarter of the delegates that were at stake on Super Tuesday. Michigan is the biggest prize, with 125 delegates, followed by Washington (89), Missouri (68), Mississippi (36), Idaho (20) and North Dakota (14). Michigan, Washington and Missouri \u2014 and their combined 282 delegates \u2014 make up 80% of the delegates at stake Tuesday.</p>", "<p>So what are the keys to each state? Here's a state-by-state guide:</p>", "<p><strong>Delegates at stake:</strong> 125<br><strong>Polls close:</strong> 9 p.m. ET. (Most polls close at 8 p.m. ET, but four counties are in the Central time zone.)</p>", "<p>Michigan figures to be a narrative-setting election. Sanders pulled off the upset there in 2016. If he can do it again, it could, once again, change the momentum of this race.</p>", "<p>To do that, he's going to have to run up the score with young voters and whites without college degrees. Young voters were about one-fifth of the electorate in the 2016 Democratic primary, according to exit polls. But so far in this primary campaign, young voters have been down as a share of the electorate. Does that change with Sanders' appeal to them this week?</p>", "<p>A significant share of Michigan's Democratic primary electorate is made up of whites without college degrees \u2014 36% in 2016. Sanders won 57% of them.</p>", "<p>Black voters could be a significant factor as well. In 2016, they were 21% of the electorate, and Hillary Clinton won more than two-thirds of them. Black voters have buoyed Biden to this point, and he needs them to turn out for him again.</p>", "<p>But perhaps the most important group that could swing the election is white women. They were 37% of the Michigan electorate in 2016, and Sanders won them narrowly. But on Super Tuesday overall, Biden won white women by double digits.</p>", "<p>If that happens again in Michigan, it could be game over.</p>", "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.clickondetroit.com/decision-2020/2020/03/04/poll-where-michigan-voters-stand-ahead-of-the-2020-democratic-primary-election/\">poll </a>conducted before Super Tuesday had Biden up by 6 points, but polls, as we've seen, can change quickly. Also signaling the state's importance, both campaigns have spent the most ad money there. As of Thursday, Sanders' campaign was slightly outspending Biden on air and online, $930,000 to $869,000.</p>", "<p><strong>Delegates at stake:</strong> 89<br><strong>Polls close: </strong>11 p.m. ET</p>", "<p>The biggest change from 2016 to 2020 in Washington is state Democrats ditched precinct caucuses for a primary. Sanders ran up the score in 2016, winning almost three-quarters of the delegates and every county there, but a primary will make things more competitive. There hasn't been much public polling, but <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=017c2b2d-c3b9-4315-9f9d-874cd64ba945\">one poll from last week </a>had the race neck and neck.</p>", "<p>There were no exit or entrance polls in 2016, but Washington is about two-thirds white, has a slightly higher level of residents with bachelor's degrees than the nation as a whole and has a higher-than-average Asian American population. It's also 13% Latino and only 4% black.</p>", "<p>The largest share of the state's vote comes from King County, where Seattle is located. But the Puget Sound area has been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/07/813192629/coronavirus-florida-reports-1st-deaths-on-east-coast-event-cancellations-mount\">one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus</a>.

But Clinton <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/primaries/polls/mo/Dem\">overwhelmingly won</a> black voters and voters over 45, and she won white women narrowly.</p>", "<p>The state's electorate trends older, and black voters (21%) and white women (40%) were significant shares of the electorate. They may very well be a deciding factor again.</p>", "<p>Much of the vote comes from St. Louis, Kansas City and surrounding counties, with smaller patches from the southwestern and southeastern parts of the state. Clinton won the cities; Sanders won most of the rural areas and the college town of Columbia.</p>", "<p>Missouri has seen the second-most advertising of the Big Tuesday states. As of Thursday, Sanders had spent $524,000 and Biden $484,000.</p>", "<p><strong>Delegates at stake: </strong>36<br><strong>Polls close: </strong>8 p.m. ET</p>", "<p>Biden is the favorite to scoop up a big share of the delegates, because the state's electorate is expected to be overwhelmingly black.

You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\"</p>", "<p>\"At the very best, his comments were astonishingly reckless and irresponsible,\" McConnell said.</p>", "<p>He added, \"The minority leader of the United States Senate threatened two associate justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. Period.\" He suggested Schumer should \"withdraw his comments and apologize.\"</p>", "<p>President Trump also blasted Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1235588587690676224\">on Twitter, </a>saying he \"has brought great danger to the steps of the United States Supreme Court.\"</p>", "<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Schumer has brought great danger to the steps of the United States Supreme Court!</p>", "<p>\"No matter the intention, words carrying the apparent threat of violence can have horrific unintended violence,\" McConnell said.</p>", "<p>Shortly after McConnell's stern lecture, Schumer came to the Senate floor and told his colleagues: \"I should not have used the words I used yesterday. They did not come out the way I intended to.\"</p>", "<p>He explained, \"I'm from Brooklyn, we speak in strong language.\" </p>", "<p>Schumer didn't apologize, and instead explained that he felt \"passionately\" about the issue the court was considering \u2014 whether to uphold a Louisiana law that would restrict access to abortion services.</p>", "<p>\"So, yes, I am angry. The women of America are angry. And, yes, we will continue to fight for a woman's right to choose. I will continue to fight for the women of America,\" the New York Democrat said.</p>", "<p>Schumer's remarks on the steps of the Supreme Court were supposed to be a reference to Kavanaugh's warning to Democratic senators about the fight over his record in 2018 at his confirmation hearing, \"You sowed the wind. For decades to come, I fear the country will reap the whirlwind.\"</p>", "<p>In a rare public rebuke, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/812222034/supreme-court-weighs-abortion-case-schumer-remarks-draw-rebuke-from-roberts\">Chief Justice John Roberts responded to Schumer</a> late Wednesday. \"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, noted that judges are appointed to a lifetime term to be \"free from political pressure.\" He said Schumer's remarks were \"an injection of partisan politics into a process that should be immune to them. At worst, it was a threat targeting two sitting members of the Supreme Court.\"</p>", "<p>Schumer pushed back at those lawmakers who argued he was inciting violence.</p>", "<p>\"I did not intend to suggest anything other than political and public opinion consequences for the Supreme Court,\" he said, \"and it is a gross distortion to imply otherwise.\"</p>", "<p>Senate Republicans worked to put pressure on those Democrats in competitive races in 2020 to speak out against Schumer.</p>", "<p>\"Chuck Schumer's reprehensible attack on Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh was met by predictable silence from the Democratic candidates Schumer's DSCC and other dark money entities are spending millions to elect,\" Jesse Hunt, spokesman for the Senate GOP campaign arm, said about Democrats backed by the leadership. \"Every single DSCC-backed candidate beholden to Schumer's money machine should demonstrate a degree of decency and disavow the dangerous attack on our independent judiciary.\"</p>", "<p>Schumer's office initially didn't back down from the comments when GOP lawmakers decried them Wednesday.

Conservatives continue to point to Trump's record appointing and confirming Kavanaugh and Gorsuch plus hundreds of lower court judges to the bench. Liberal groups concerned about the impact Republican-approved nominees will have on abortion and other issues are working to remind voters about the influence a Democratic president could have if any justices decide to retire.</p>", "<p>McConnell vowed his party would be on watch for any further criticism from Democrats of the independent judiciary, saying, \"This majority will ensure the only casualties of this recklessness are the reputations of those who engage in it.\" </p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

That approach is now colliding with a public health emergency in the form of coronavirus. </p>", "<p>The challenge posed by Trump's breezy style was on full display Wednesday night in an interview in which he disputed the World Health Organization's recent coronavirus death rate estimate of 3.4%.</p>", "<p>\"Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number,\" Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News. \"Now, this is just my hunch, and \u2014 but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it's very mild. They will get better very rapidly.

They say the mortality rate could decrease as more is understood about the disease.</p>", "<p>\"We are still very early in understanding. All the evidence isn't there,\" said Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant health secretary in charge of public health. Giroir told reporters on Capitol Hill that modeling suggests that the death rate is likely lower than 1%. That's higher than the death rate for the seasonal flu, which is typically around 0.1% and 0.15%.</p>", "<p>The WHO rate compares the number of deaths with the number of people tested.

Brittany Pettersen with her husband Ian Silverii and their dog Ollie, last August in their home in Colorado. Petterson, who gave birth to the couple's son this year, has lobbied hard to expand paid family and medical leave throughout the state.</p>", "<p>When <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/legislators/brittany-pettersen\">Brittany Pettersen</a>, a Colorado state senator, gave birth to a boy in January, she became only the second lawmaker in the state to have a baby during a legislative season.<br><strong></strong></p>", "<p>The first, Sen. Barbara Holme, delivered just two days before lawmakers adjourned nearly 40 years ago. But because she was part of a Democratic minority at the time, no one worried much about the votes Holme was missing, much less her need for paid maternity leave.</p>", "<p>\"That was the year I was born,\" says Pettersen, also a Democrat. \"Unfortunately, we haven't come very far from 1981.\"</p>", "<p>Despite the inroads women have made entering the workforce and politics, paid family and medical leave remains a heavy lift in Colorado and across much of the country. For each of the past six years, the Colorado legislature has considered bills to establish a statewide paid leave program, but none have passed.</p>", "<p>Yet this year, with a Democratic governor, Democratic control of both the state House and Senate, plus more female legislators than ever before, many thought it would be the best chance for a paid leave bill in the 30 years since Holme had her baby.</p>", "<p>Pettersen has become something of a poster child \u2014 perhaps, a poster mom \u2014 for this year's legislative push. While undoubtedly many male lawmakers have had children while serving, her fellow senators may find Pettersen's example hard to ignore if a paid leave bill comes to the floor.</p>", "<p>\"This is our opportunity to help Coloradans. And we're going through it, even in our workplace,\" says Pettersen, who took one month of paid leave from her legislative work. (Colorado legislators are allowed to take up to 40 days of fully compensated leave, but their salary is reduced if they're out longer for anything other than a medical illness.)</p>", "<p>Still, even after a bipartisan task force came to broad consensus this year for a mandatory paid family leave benefit run by the state and funded through payroll taxes, Coloradans may have to settle for something far less ambitious if anything passes at all. The fight illustrates just how divisive paid family leave can be when determining how to pay for it.</p>", "<p><strong>Legislative hurdles</strong></p>", "<p>Under federal law, employers with 50 or more employees are required to grant workers time off to deal with family or medical issues, including the birth of a child or the care of an aging parent. But companies are not required to pay workers for that time off.</p>", "<p>Many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have backed paid leave and President Donald Trump's budget envisioned a paid family leave program. Congress is now considering the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act that would provide workers up to 12 weeks of partial income for family leave regardless of the company's size, funded through a payroll tax of 2 cents per $10 in wages. Congress passed a bill last year that will grant 12 weeks of paid family leave to federal employees, beginning in October.</p>", "<p>Some states have sought to fill the gaps and, so far, eight states \u2014 California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington \u2014 along with the District of Columbia have established paid family leave programs, funded through payroll taxes. For a while, at least, Colorado looked poised to join them.</p>", "<p>Colorado Republicans have killed paid leave bills in years past. But last year, when Democrats took control, paid leave looked like a possibility.</p>", "<p>\"That's also when all the details really started to matter,\" says Kathy White, deputy director of the Colorado Fiscal Institute, a nonprofit research and policy advocacy organization, which backed a paid leave benefit.</p>", "<p>As a result, the 2019 paid leave bill was the most lobbied legislation in Colorado that session, according to backers, with more than 200 lobbyists registered as working on it. But, ultimately, lawmakers were unable to come to an agreement and instead established a task force to study the issue.</p>", "<p><strong>A broad consensus</strong></p>", "<p>The 13-member bipartisan panel spent months poring through examples from other states and studies that looked at the costs and benefits of providing family and medical leave. They reviewed more than 1,000 public comments submitted in just 30 days.</p>", "<p>In January, the task force issued its final recommendations with broad consensus among its members. It backed what's called a state-run social insurance model to levy a small payroll tax to cover the paychecks of those taking paid leave.</p>", "<p>\"This has become a really big issue because the research is becoming so clear,\" White says. \"We can see the difference between those who have leave and those who don't have leave or have to take unpaid leave for caregiving needs.\"</p>", "<p>A state-commissioned review found strong evidence that paid leave decreased infant mortality by 10% to 13%, increased the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months, increased childhood immunization rates and improved maternal mental health.</p>", "<p>But the task force recommendations were met with objections from various lawmakers, as well as Gov. Jared Polis. He had asked the task force to consider paid leave models other than a state-run program.</p>", "<p>Some opposed the new payroll taxes, while others were concerned about the state's potential costs if payroll taxes don't collect enough. Critics have argued that paid leave mandates offer employers little flexibility to meet an employee's specific needs \u2014 and can create an economic burden for businesses.</p>", "<p>By February, the bill's sponsors had shifted to a compromise that would require companies to offer paid family and medical time off, but would leave it up to employers to determine how to provide that.</p>", "<p>It's not nearly the benefit that paid-leave advocates had hoped for.</p>", "<p>\"I would have preferred a social insurance plan,\" says Democratic Sen. <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/legislators/faith-winter\">Faith Winter</a>, the bill's lead sponsor. \"Ultimately, you could have a perfect bill that doesn't pass, or you could have a good bill that passes.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Waning support</strong></p>", "<p>Now it's unclear whether the compromise bill has given up too much ground to pass. Already, two of Winter's Democratic co-sponsors have dropped their names from the revised bill, calling into question whether it will have enough votes.</p>", "<p>\"It's a big program with lots of details, and it impacts every person in the state,\" Winter says. \"When you start moving things that affect everyone and every business, that means everyone cares.\"</p>", "<p>The coalition of nonprofits and advocacy groups pushing for paid family and medical leave does have a backstop. Early this year, proponents registered two paid leave ballot measures for the November elections.</p>", "<p>\"Colorado families overwhelmingly want and expect the legislature to move forward with a plan to provide family and medical leave this year,\" says Lynea Hansen, a spokesperson for <a href=\"https://www.coloradofamiliesfirst.org/\">Colorado Families First</a>, a nonprofit that has been lobbying in favor of a paid leave bill. \"If the legislature is unsuccessful at passing a comprehensive policy, we plan to take this initiative to the voters.\"</p>", "<p>It's unknown whether the backers of the ballot measure would continue to press the issue if the legislature passes the compromise bill instead of the full state-run benefit advocates sought.</p>", "<p>\"What happens if the legislature does do something and it's still not good enough for the advocates?\" asks <a href=\"https://cochamber.com/staff/loren-furman/\">Loren Furman</a>, senior vice president of state and federal relations for the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, which has been supportive of a paid leave bill. \"Are they then going to continue down the path of the ballot initiative?\"</p>", "<p>If nothing else, the additional time it took to rework the bill has allowed Pettersen to be back from her one-month maternity leave in time for debate on the bill. The Democrats hold a slim 19-16 margin in the Senate and cannot count on a strict party-line vote, because some party members are wavering in their support for the new approach.</p>", "<p>Pettersen has pledged to bring her infant son, Davis, to the chamber floor for the crucial vote \u2014 a tangible display of what's at stake.</p>", "<p>\"It's just another reminder,\" she says. \"There are numerous moms that have been elected.

In her last days as a candidate, she was still releasing new plans \u2014 including a coronavirus plan she outlined in Houston on Saturday night, even as disappointing results came in from South Carolina.</p>", "<p>That focus on laying out proposals inspired devotion in her legions of supporters, like Maryanne Schuessler \u2014 who was a volunteer in Warren's Columbia, S.C., office.</p>", "<p>\"She's so well-planned,\" she said, sighing sharply. \"God! It's \u2014 I don't think she's going to do very well in this primary. And it breaks my heart.\"</p>", "<p>In her final week on the trail, before dropping out on Thursday, it was clear that Warren's plans \u2014 not just what was in them, but the fact that they existed \u2014 inspired deep trust among her supporters even as her path to the nomination looked narrow.</p>", "<p>Amber Schafer works in health insurance sales for a living, and she showed up at a Warren event in Columbia, S.C., the day of that state's primary. She said she was definitely voting for Warren \u2014 even though \"Medicare for All,\" which Warren backs, would virtually eliminate private insurers (bad news for an insurance saleswoman). But Schafer had faith that a President Warren would be able to help deal with job losses.</p>", "<p>\"Would it mean that lots of people have to look for different kinds of jobs?

She co-sponsored Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan \u2014 which didn't contain a detailed way to raise revenue \u2014 and ran on it. So as people awaited her plan to pay for it, she became a target of opponents like Pete Buttigieg in debates.</p>", "<p>\"Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything \u2014 except this,\" he chided her at a September debate.</p>", "<p>Those weren't the only reasons she failed to win over a broader coalition of voters. In addition, her progressive politics were simply too far left for some Democrats. And she was never able to gain the traction she needed among African Americans and Latinos.</p>", "<p>Warren supporter Yvie Siferd, who saw her in Detroit on Tuesday, had other ideas why she thought Warren came up short. She listed those factors as she saw them: \"Misogyny. Name recognition.

Cast a vote that will make you proud. Cast a vote from your heart. And vote for the person you think will make the best president of the United States,\" she added, to roaring applause.</p>", "<p>Warren occupied an awkward place in the field. She was popular enough to draw those big, loud crowds \u2014 she pulled in 3,000 people in Los Angeles on Monday night and 2,200 in Detroit on Tuesday.

But this week, the Vermont senator acknowledged that those voters, on which his success to some degree hinges, have not shown up in the way he'd hoped.</p>", "<p>After 14 states held primary contests on Super Tuesday, Sanders acknowledged to reporters that he'd been \"disappointed\" with the results.</p>", "<p>\"Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? The answer is no,\" Sanders told reporters at a news conference at his Burlington, Vt., headquarters. Sanders went on to acknowledge the undeniable challenge that any candidate banking on the support of younger voters faces: They do not vote in high numbers, compared with other groups.</p>", "<p>\"I think that will change in the general election, but I will be honest with you, we have not done as well with bringing young people into the process,\" Sanders said. \"It is not easy.\"</p>", "<p>While young voters were part of the coalition that propelled Sanders to victory in California, those under age 30 made up just 11% of the electorate, according to exit polls. Another 35% were between the ages of 45 and 64, and 30% were 65 or older.</p>", "<p>In Texas, a state that Biden won though the demographics were supposed to favor Sanders, just 16% of voters were younger than 30, while 38% were between the ages of 45 and 64, and 24% were 65 and older.</p>", "<p>Even in Sanders' home state of Vermont, voters younger than 30 made up just 11% of Super Tuesday voters, according to exit polls. Roughly 70% of voters were over age 45.</p>", "<p>Of the 14 states that held primary contests on Tuesday, participation by voters younger than 30 didn't exceed 20% in any state, according to an analysis of exit polls.</p>", "<p>Given the huge turnout, including youth turnout, in the 2018 midterms, many had predicted, or at least hoped, that the trend would continue during the 2020 Democratic primaries. But so far, at least, there is no clear evidence of greater participation by the young people that Sanders has said he can motivate to get out to the polls.</p>", "<p>\"When I look at the collection of data, from multiple sources, there is no evidence of an increase or surge in the youth vote,\" John Della Volpe, the polling director of Harvard University's Institute of Politics, said. \"In fact, there is considerable evidence to suggest that the youth vote is flat or declining relative to the previous election cycles.\"</p>", "<p>He used North Carolina as an example, noting that while turnout statewide was up 17%, youth turnout was down 9%. </p>", "<p>Other experts have been looking at the youth vote this year using different benchmarks.</p>", "<p>The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University argues that it's more relevant to compare youth turnout this year with 2012 turnout, the most recent election cycle in which there was only a single competitive primary, rather than 2016.</p>", "<p>\"If we compare to the 2016 primaries we're comparing to a primary where there was a huge Republican field, there were tons of Republican campaigns doing outreach, there was so much media.,\" said CIRCLE's Director of Impact Abby Kiesa. \"The environment and the levers and the things that we know affect youth turnout aren't fully maximized when it's only one competitive primary.\"</p>", "<p>Kiesa said that when comparing Super Tuesday turnout this year with 2012, young people turned out at rates either on par or above 2012 levels.</p>", "<p>\n                Corey Brothers tries to guess the name of candidate Bernie Sanders as he plays the guessing game \"Heads Up!\" while waiting in line to vote on Super Tuesday at the Cleveland Park Community Center precinct in Nashville, Tenn.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Mark Humphrey/AP\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Corey Brothers tries to guess the name of candidate Bernie Sanders as he plays the guessing game \"Heads Up!\" while waiting in line to vote on Super Tuesday at the Cleveland Park Community Center precinct in Nashville, Tenn.</p>", "<p>Experts have a variety of theories on why young voters aren't turning out as campaigns hope they will. </p>", "<p>Della Volpe said that unlike during the 2018 midterms, when President Trump's policies (though not the candidate himself) were on the ballot, the primaries have been about the distinctions among the Democratic candidates. </p>", "<p>\"When we're talking about engaging young people, one of the biggest things you have to do is register them,\" said Sarah Audelo, the executive director of Alliance for Youth Action who ran Hillary Clinton's millennial outreach efforts in 2016. \"They're not just young voters, they're new voters.\"</p>", "<p>She also made the point that this is work that campaigns need to be weaving into all parts of their apparatus.</p>", "<p>\"It's a sign of not good things to come when you have to start from scratch,\" she said. \"Young people should be invested, like any other voter group.\"</p>", "<p>Ben Wessel, the executive director of NextGen America, the Tom Steyer-backed group that works on mobilizing young voters, said that in many youth-dense precincts, youth turnout was up \u2014 and in some cases by volumes.</p>", "<p>\"Young people are turning out, but they don't view voting as the end all, be all,\" Wessel said. \"They see voting as a tool in their tool box, and they'd be foolish not to use it, but that's not how they are going to stop clamoring for change. They've seen that we elect awesome people, and still we have stasis and still we have a system that's not working for young folks.\"</p>", "<p>Wessel and others agreed that youth turnout in the primary is not necessarily a strong indicator of youth turnout in the general election. But he also said that candidates need to take young voter outreach seriously early on.</p>", "<p>\"As we move towards the general election, we're going to need to see candidates talking about the issues that young people care about in an authentic and consistent way,\" Wessel warned. \"Because if you think you can show up with just two weeks to go and say, 'Yeah, yeah I'm with you, and what are you going to do, vote for Trump?' It's not enough, and it's certainly not enough in an election year like this year where we know the other side is going to come out in record numbers.\"</p>", "<p>Della Volpe agreed with this sentiment and thinks some of the non-Sanders candidates have missed an opportunity. Sanders has centered young people in his movement from Day 1. Other candidates haven't had the same focus.</p>", "<p>\"It seems to me that they made strategic decisions not to focus on younger voters,\" he said. \"Perhaps they thought they were all going to be with Bernie.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Warren suspended her campaign Thursday and has not endorsed any of the remaining candidates.</p>", "<p>In the once-crowded Democratic primary field, Biden had staked his position in the race as being the candidate who would appeal most to black Americans. After his underwhelming performance in Iowa and New Hampshire, which are more than 90% white, the importance of that was clear. Post-Super Tuesday data show that in those counties that were most white, Sanders narrowly beat out Biden.</p>", "<p>But the former vice president fared better in counties with higher percentages of nonwhite residents, beating Sanders in those counties.

The group resumed offensive operations against Afghan security forces this week, ending a partial truce.</p>", "<p>With less than four days to go before peace talks are to begin in Afghanistan between that nation's authorities and the Taliban insurgency, things are not looking promising.  </p>", "<p>Taliban fighters are stepping up attacks on Afghan security forces. American warplanes are counterattacking. And a prisoner exchange that was to take place before those intra-Afghan talks start is being rejected by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. </p>", "<p>On Friday in western Kabul, the Associated Press reports that gunmen opened fire at a largely Shiite gathering, killing at least 32 and injuring scores more.  The Islamic State-Khorasan Province claimed <a href=\"http://thefortress.com.pk/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-kabul-attack-that-killed-27/\">responsibility</a> for the attack.</p>", "<p>All this comes after the U.S. and the Taliban \u2014 but not the Afghan government \u2014 signed an agreement Feb. 29 in Doha, Qatar with the stated aim of \"bringing peace to Afghanistan\" more than 18 years after U.S. forces pushed the Taliban out of power. </p>", "<p>\"We know that the road ahead will be difficult,\" <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/secretary-pompeos-remarks-to-the-press/\">said</a> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Thursday. \"We expected it.  We were right.\"</p>", "<p>Despite declaring the upsurge in violence \"unacceptable,\" Pompeo did not insist it end altogether. \"It's time to move forward. It's time to reduce violence. It's time to sit down and talk,\" he said. </p>", "<p>President Trump also is pushing hard on the agreement. By making a phone call this week to Taliban deputy leader and co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Trump became the first American president to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/811722555/trump-says-he-spoke-to-taliban-leader-following-peace-agreement\">speak</a> directly with the Taliban since the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.</p>", "<p>But one leading expert on the complexities of Afghanistan cautions that Taliban fighters, having secured a peace agreement with the U.S., may not be ready yet to sit down and talk with Afghan authorities, whom they see as U.S. puppets.</p>", "<p>\"They want to indicate that they still have the capacity to fight if their demands are not met,\" says <a href=\"https://cic.nyu.edu/people/barnett-rubin\">Barnett Rubin</a>, a former State Department senior adviser on Afghanistan who directs New York University's Afghanistan-Pakistan Regional Project. \"And they have the additional incentive that President Ghani said that he will refuse to release the prisoners before the talks start. So escalating militarily is a way of trying to put pressure on him to soften his position.\"</p>", "<p><strong>'We still have confidence'</strong></p>", "<p>Rubin notes that the Taliban seem confident the U.S. will not pull the plug on a deal promising the withdrawal of all American forces within 14 months: \"I think everyone who observes Donald Trump should have concluded long ago that he's decided to get out of Afghanistan.\"</p>", "<p>Asked during Congressional testimony this week about the Taliban's renewed violence, joint chiefs chairman Gen. Mark Milley made clear he did not consider it a deal breaker.</p>", "<p>\"Yes, there was significant numbers of attacks, small attacks,\" the Pentagon's top military official <a href=\"https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/20-03-04-department-of-defense-budget-posture-\">told</a> the Senate Armed Services Committee.  \"They were all beaten back.\"</p>", "<p>Pompeo, for his part, went so far as to hail efforts to reduce violence that he said were being made by the insurgency's leaders. \"We still have confidence,\" he said Thursday, \"that the Taliban leadership was working to deliver on its commitments.\" </p>", "<p>Any commitments that may have been made to reduce violence do not appear in the four-page agreement signed in Doha. Its only reference to the ongoing fighting is a stipulation that participants in the proposed intra-Afghan negotiations \"will discuss the date and modalities of a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.\" </p>", "<p>Still, the top American commander in Afghanistan warns that the ongoing violence could imperil the Doha accord. </p>", "<p>\"If the Taliban are not going to lower violence, that causes a risk to this agreement,\" Gen. Scott Miller <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TOLOnews/status/1235122412884283392\">told </a>Afghanistan's TOLO news agency earlier this week. \"Which is why we've gone directly to the Taliban, said you need to lower your violence \u2014 otherwise, it's hard to have an agreement.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Prisoner exchange remains uncertain</strong></p>", "<p>The Doha agreement does have language specifically calling for the release of detained combatants: \"Up to five thousand (5,000) prisoners of ... the Taliban and up to one thousand (1,000) prisoners of the other side will be released by March 10, 2020, the first day of intra-Afghan negotiations.\" </p>", "<p>But a joint declaration issued by Afghan president Ashraf Ghani and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on the same day the Doha agreement was signed lacks any similar specific commitment to a prisoner release, according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-afghanistan-taliban-prisoners/differing-u-s-documents-helped-fuel-afghan-prisoner-dispute-idUSKBN20Q01D\">Reuters</a>.  It simply calls for the Afghan government's participation in a \"U.S.-facilitated discussion with Taliban representatives on confidence-building, to include determining the feasibility of releasing significant numbers of prisoners on both sides.\"</p>", "<p>\"Those aren't remotely inconsistent,\" Pompeo declared when asked about the apparent discrepancy regarding a prisoner swap between the documents the U.S. signed with the Taliban and the declaration it made in Kabul. \"These were heavily negotiated documents. All the parties understand that it's time for prisoner exchanges to take place.\"</p>", "<p>Pompeo added that the U.S. continues \"to press all sides to stop posturing, start a practical discussion about prisoner releases, knuckle down and prepare for the upcoming intra-Afghan negotiations.\"</p>", "<p>Like Pompeo, NYU's Rubin was in Doha for the signing ceremony.  He says if the document's call for the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners had not been included, the agreement would not have been signed by the insurgency. </p>", "<p>\"The Taliban understood it as a commitment by the United States to get the prisoners released. That is what they're standing firm,\" says Rubin. \"The United States is standing by the literal meaning of the words, but trying to persuade the [Afghan] government.  It is ambiguous in a way that diplomatic documents are often ambiguous.\"</p>", "<p>Despite his stated refusal to go along with the prisoner release, President Ghani did meet Friday evening with U.S. Special Representative for Afghan Reconciliation <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/biographies/zalmay-khalilzad/\">Zalmay Khalilzad</a>, the Afghan-born American diplomat who signed the agreement with the Taliban in Doha.</p>", "<p>\"Both sides talked about the future steps in the peace process,\" Ghani's spokesman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SediqSediqqi/status/1235975296135974912\">wrote</a> on Twitter, \"and [the] start of the negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban.\"</p>", "<p>While those talks are slated to begin March 10, Barnett says that's unlikely to happen without concessions.</p>", "<p>\"The Taliban will not agree to start the talks without the prisoner exchange. The Afghan government says it will not agree to start the talks without a ceasefire,\" he says. \"So at this point, it's very unlikely the talks will go forward in the immediate future.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Some results are still expected Tuesday night, but the detailed results used to allocate delegates may not be available until<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>tomorrow.</p>", "<p>For the first time, the state allowed any eligible voter to request and cast a mail-in ballot for the primary, but the state legislature did not update its laws to allow local election officials to open or handle those ballots before election<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>day.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe legislature has not given us more time or resources to process the twice-as-many number of [mail-in] ballots that we\u2019ve had this time around,\u201d said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, in an interview with NPR. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s why we\u2019re anticipating it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer for our clerks and their poll workers to count the ballots<span class=\"widont\">\u00a0</span>today.\u201d</p>", "<p>This election could be a preview for November too.

It\u2019s a state that Sanders narrowly won in 2016. If he wins it, it could reshape the race yet again.

The data collected will be transferred <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/biometric-analysis/codis/ndis-statistics\">to an FBI database</a>, so that in the future, law enforcement officials could check if these samples matched any DNA recovered from a crime scene.  </p>", "<p>Immigrant rights advocates describe it as dehumanizing and a serious breach of privacy against vulnerable populations. \"It's about miscasting these individuals, many of whom are seeking asylum in this country ... as people who pose a threat that somehow would justify holding onto the most intimate information about them indefinitely,\" Naureen Shah, senior advocacy and policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, tells NPR. She notes the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/medical-and-genetic-privacy/rapid-dna-machines-police-departments-need/\">ACLU also opposes DNA collection</a> from people arrested or investigated for crimes, due to concerns about the risk of misidentification.<strong> </strong></p>", "<p>The Justice Department said Friday that it is formally amending regulations and pushing forward with the DNA collection plan, which was first floated in October.

EV boosters concerned about climate change want even more and they say governments should help speed the transition away from internal combustion cars. </p>", "<p>New Jersey passed <a href=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2018/Bills/S2500/2252_U2.HTM\">an ambitious law</a> in January aimed at having 330,000 electric cars on state roads by the end of 2025. And by 2040 New Jersey wants 85% of cars sold in the state to be electric. </p>", "<p>N.J. Gov. Phil Murphy says the law is part of his <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/emp/\">state's goal</a> of reaching 100 percent clean energy by 2050. </p>", "<p>The law  includes up to $300 million in rebates over 10 years to electric vehicle buyers. </p>", "<p>\"And it's not just any old rebate. It's 'cash on the hood' rebate. You walk into a dealer, there's a car that's $35,000, that car's $30,000 to you,\" says Pam Frank, CEO of the group <a href=\"http://www.chargevc.org/\">ChargEVC</a>, which includes utilities, car dealers and environmental groups. </p>", "<p>Frank is not just an advocate for EVs, she's an evangelist. That's why she drives a bright Orange Chevrolet Bolt. </p>", "<p>\"I wanted people to notice I was driving this electric machine, which I'm very proud of,\" Frank says. And if anyone asks she'll tell them it's fun to drive, it's fast, it reduces her carbon foot print and it's quiet. </p>", "<p>Frank's group pushed for the new law, which also calls for charging stations to be built around the state to overcome \"range anxiety,\" or the fear a car's battery will run out with no place to charge. </p>", "<p>The New Jersey law along with incentives in states such as <a href=\"https://cleanvehiclerebate.org/eng\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://goelectric.oregon.gov/incentives-rebates\">Oregon</a> and <a href=\"https://marylandev.org/incentives/\">Maryland</a>, all come at an important time for utilities. After decades of steadily increasing electricity consumption, U.S. <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38572\">demand has leveled off</a>, thanks in part to more efficient appliances and lighting. </p>", "<p>If more EVs are on the road that means utilities will sell more electricity. </p>", "<p>\"New Jersey is an exciting one because outside of California it's probably the biggest piece of legislation that we've seen that's supportive of clean transportation,\" says Chris Budzynski, director of utility policy at <a href=\"https://www.exeloncorp.com/\">Exelon</a>.</p>", "<p>And the law comes as a <a href=\"https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml\">federal tax credit</a> of up to $7,500 is starting to expire. The credits are available for only the first 200,000 cars a manufacturer sells. GM and Tesla already hit that ceiling. </p>", "<p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-16/trump-helped-nix-electric-car-tax-measure-sought-by-tesla-gm\">helped block</a> efforts to raise that limit last December. As a field, <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30705242/democratic-candidates-positions-cars-policy/\">Democratic presidential candidates</a> are much more supportive of EV subsidies. So if voters choose a new president next November more federal help may come. Until then Budzynski is pleased to see states taking action to speed the transition to electric cars. </p>", "<p>\"This does represent one of the most significant or more significant opportunities for us, probably, over the course of the last 100 years with the exception of the introduction of air conditioning,\" Budzynski says. </p>", "<p>Not everyone is happy with this trend. Oil companies, especially those focused on refining, stand to lose gasoline sales if EVs take off. </p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/16/oil-industry-electric-car-1729429\">They've opposed some state efforts</a>, often echoing arguments from consumer advocates such as Stefanie Brand, director of the <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/rpa/\">New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel</a>. Her job is to defend utility customers' interests. </p>", "<p>\"Most of those customers can't afford an electric vehicle because the cheapest electric vehicle at this point is about $30,000,\" Brand says.  </p>", "<p>Often these state programs allow utilities to collect ratepayer money to build things such as charging stations. <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/rpa/docs/A4819_A4634_S2252_Concerning%20the%20Use%20of%20Plug-In%20Electric%20Vehicle_1-3-20.pdf\">Brand says</a> that's not fair because poor ratepayers are subsidizing wealthier ones who can afford an EV. </p>", "<p>Electric car advocates point out everyone benefits from cleaner air and efforts to address climate change. And there are <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/max-baumhefner/electric-vehicles-are-driving-rates-down\">studies</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.synapse-energy.com/sites/default/files/EV-Impacts-June-2019-18-122.pdf\">one focused on California</a> \u2014 the state with the most EVs \u2014 showing a lot more electric cars on the road could actually <em>reduce</em> rates.</p>", "<p>Brand says there's a catch though, \"Until you reach a critical mass of electric vehicles, you're not going to see those effects.\"</p>", "<p>For New Jersey's EV law, Brand says her concerns for poorer ratepayers were addressed. Money from a fund already dedicated to public benefits will be used for the EV rebates. </p>", "<p>Still debates like this will continue as more states seek to boost electric vehicles.

The administration leaves key jobs vacant at a given agency, while delegating the authority of those positions down to subordinates who do not need to be confirmed or even nominated for the jobs. </p>", "<p>Trump has often said <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711094554/an-acting-government-for-the-trump-administration\">he likes installing \"acting\" officials</a> because it gives him more flexibility. His administration has been sued over this, and recently lost a court case over the practice, when a federal judge found that it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/01/811023475/judge-says-ken-cuccinelli-was-appointed-unlawfully-to-top-immigration-post\">hired a top immigration official unlawfully</a>. </p>", "<p>Now the Trump administration is increasingly turning to the more obscure tactic that leads to those lengthy titles. It's known as delegation. </p>", "<p>\"That's the shocking thing \u2014 just how many positions are working because of these delegations,\" says Anne Joseph O'Connell, an expert on administrative law at Stanford Law School. </p>", "<p>Why not just name acting directors and deputies to fill these open positions? The answer, O'Connell says, lies in a law known as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which lays out extensive rules about who can be appointed to serve in Senate-confirmed jobs, and for how long.</p>", "<p>Federal Judge Randolph Moss <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6791555-L-M-M-et-al-Plaintiffs-v-KENNETH-T-CUCCINELLI-II.html\">ruled last week </a>that the Trump administration violated the vacancies act when it filled the top job at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. In that case, the administration hired immigration hardliner Ken Cuccinelli for a job that didn't previously exist, then immediately promoted him to run the entire agency as acting director. </p>", "<p>In his ruling, Judge Moss referred to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA9kQuWkU7I\">a long-running gag</a> on<em> The Office</em>, the classic sitcom about bureaucratic absurdity, about the difference between \"assistant regional manager\" and \"assistant to the regional manager.\" On <em>The Office</em>, the title difference doesn't really matter, the judge wrote, because either way, the manager's assistant isn't really in charge. </p>", "<p>But in the federal government, titles are serious business and they do signal who's in charge. The judge found that the Trump administration violated the vacancies act by creating a job for Cuccinelli that was \"second in command in name only.\"</p>", "<p>Cuccinelli still holds a top job in the administration. His <a href=\"https://twitter.com/homelandken\">Twitter account</a> identifies him as the \"acting deputy secretary\" at the Department of Homeland Security. But technically, his new job title is much longer than that: <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/leadership\">senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary</a>. </p>", "<p>Even Cuccinelli sees the humor in his \"short little title,\" as he jokingly called it before a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/joint-efforts-on-border-security-and-regional-partnerships-across-central-america/\">briefing at the Foreign Press Center</a> in December. </p>", "<p>\"Of course, that acronym is SOPDDS,\" he deadpanned.  </p>", "<p>Also at the Department of Homeland Security, there's Randolph \"Tex\" Alles, who's serving as the senior official performing the duties of the under secretary for management. At the Department of the Interior, William Perry Pendley is serving as the deputy director of policy programs at the Bureau of Land Management, \"exercising the authority\" of the director.  </p>", "<p>Legal experts say there are several reasons the Trump administration might turn to delegation instead of putting officials in charge in an \"acting\" capacity.</p>", "<p>\"The vacancies act has time limits,\" O'Connell says. \"But these delegations typically don't.\"</p>", "<p>In most cases, O'Connell says you can hold the \"acting\" title in a job that requires Senate approval for only so long, usually about seven months. With delegation, there's no time limit. A subordinate can effectively take on the boss's responsibilities indefinitely.  </p>", "<p>\n                William Perry Pendley at a conference for journalists in Fort Collins, Colo., last October.

And they blame the Senate.</p>", "<p>\"The Trump administration has been somewhat frustrated with how long it takes to get people through the Senate,\" Cuccinelli said on Fox. \"So they've had to use ... these alternatives that are legal, they're just less preferential to getting a full Senate appointment.\"</p>", "<p>But the Trump administration has never formally nominated Cuccinelli \u2014 or many of these other controversial officials \u2014 for the jobs they're doing, so there's nothing for the Senate to vote on.</p>", "<p>The administration's critics call that an illegal end run around the vacancies act. They say the administration is using this strategy to install and promote officials who would have difficulty being confirmed by the Senate because of their extreme views. </p>", "<p>\"The point of Senate advice and consent is to make sure that the people running these major agencies and bureaus are within the mainstream \u2014 that is, they're not fringe characters,\" says Peter Jenkins, a lawyer with the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. </p>", "<p>Jenkins says his group may take the Trump administration to court over the current head of the Bureau of Land Management. </p>", "<p>\"William Pendley, who's running BLM now, is a fringe character,\" Jenkins said. </p>", "<p>Pendley serves as deputy director of policy programs at BLM. But thanks to delegation, he's also \"exercising the authority\" of the bureau's director. </p>", "<p>Before coming to BLM, Pendley spent his career in the private sector trying to roll back environmental rules as the head of the Mountain States Legal Foundation. And he's questioned whether the federal government should own public lands at all. </p>", "<p>\"I did spend my legal career sparring with the government,\" Pendley told NPR. \"And I represented ranchers, and miners, and loggers, and mountain climbers, and boaters. ... You name it, I represented 'em.\"</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/18/806783253/blm-acting-director-defends-agencys-controversial-move-to-colorado\">In a recent interview,</a> Pendley said he was willing to serve on a temporary basis for as long as the president wants. </p>", "<p>\"Somebody's gotta sign the documents. And so somebody has to be given the authority by the secretary of the Interior to do just that,\" Pendley said. </p>", "<p>Critics say there may be another reason the Trump administration is relying so heavily on delegation and acting officials. </p>", "<p>\"They want people running these bureaus who feel weak, who feel politically reliant on the White House,\" Jenkins says. That way, he explains, the Trump administration has a stable of high-level officials \"that they know are loyal.\" </p>", "<p>Trump is not the first president to get the job done by delegating authority down to a subordinate. The Obama administration relied on delegation extensively at the end of his second term, when senior officials were leaving the government for the private sector. </p>", "<p>\"It was a problem then too. And we called it out then too,\" said Rebecca Jones, Policy Counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog in Washington. </p>", "<p>But Jones says the title shuffling has reached new levels of \"gamesmanship\" under the Trump administration. </p>", "<p>\"It's unconstitutional, because the Constitution requires that the Senate play a role in consenting or not consenting to the president's nominees,\" Jones said. \"Major federal dollars being spent by these people. And we don't even know who they are.\"</p>", "<p>Jones says the point of Senate confirmation is to vet the president's appointees, to find out who's really in charge.</p>", "<p><em>National Desk Correspondent Kirk Siegler and Brooklyn Riepma, a National Desk intern, contributed to this report.  </em></p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Inside the court, justices heard argument in the first major abortion case of the Trump era. Schumer's remarks Wednesday critical of the court's two Trump-appointed justices drew a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>", "<p>There were fierce clashes at the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday and a fierce critique from Chief Justice John Roberts afterward upon learning about statements made by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer outside while the arguments were taking place inside. </p>", "<p>Addressing a crowd of abortion-rights demonstrators, Schumer, D-N.Y., referred to the court's two Trump appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, and said, \"You have unleashed the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\" </p>", "<p>Schumer's statement was apparently a reference to Kavanaugh's angry  statement to Democratic senators at his 2018 confirmation hearing, \"You sowed the wind. For decades to come, I fear the  country will reap the whirlwind.\"</p>", "<p>Late Wednesday Chief Justice Roberts responded to Schumer with a stern rebuke. \"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All members of the court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter,\" he said in a written statement. </p>", "<p>Schumer's office quickly replied with his own written statement, saying that his comments \"were a reference to the political price Senate Republicans will pay for putting these justices on the court, and warning that the justices will unleash a major grassroots movement on the issue of reproductive rights....\"</p>", "<p>Schumer went on to criticize the chief justice for \"remaining silent when President Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/25/809178462/trump-says-sotomayor-ginsburg-should-recuse-themselves-from-cases-involving-him\">attacked Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg</a>\" late last month. That failure to stand up for two of the court's liberals, Schumer said, shows that Roberts \"does not just call balls and strikes,\" as he promised he would do  at his confirmation hearing in 2005. </p>", "<p>Wednesday  is not the first time Roberts has rebuked a political leader.

These rulings are shocking. We need protection and security-these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Facts of the Case</strong></p>", "<p>Wednesday's blast from the chief justice came after fierce arguments before the court in a case that tests whether the court should renounce an abortion ruling that is just four years old.</p>", "<p>Back in 2016, the high court struck down a Texas law that required doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. At issue now is a nearly identical law coming out of Louisiana. But in the four years since the Texas case, the composition of the court has changed with the additions of two Trump appointees, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.</p>", "<p>With the change in the court's composition, anti-abortion groups have been pressing hard to get the court to backtrack on abortion rights, with an eye to the ultimate aim of overturning Roe v. Wade.</p>", "<p>In the Louisiana case before the court Wednesday, the state defended an admitting privileges statute nearly identical to the Texas law that the court struck down in 2016. Supporters of the law argue that Louisiana passed it to protect patient safety. </p>", "<p>\"There is a long record in Louisiana as there are in other states of really gross violations of health and safety standards in the abortion industry, we have more than 20 years of documentation,\" said Louisiana Congressman Mike Johnson on the steps of the court following oral arguments Wednesday.</p>", "<p>But Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, countered that if Louisiana's law is upheld, clinics across the state will shutter \u2014 leaving only one clinic and one doctor to serve the needs of 10,000 women seeking abortions each year in the state.  </p>", "<p>\"It is not right that we have to be here re-fighting a legal battle that we have already won. But unfortunately we are here because the state of Louisiana is in open defiance of the Constitution and of the Supreme Court's ruling,\" Northup said.</p>", "<p><strong>The arguments </strong></p>", "<p>Inside the court chamber, lawyer Julie Rikelman,  representing the Hope clinic in Shreveport, La., argued that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in upholding the Louisiana law, had disregarded the factual findings of the trial court and openly defied the Supreme Court's precedents.</p>", "<p>Conservative Justice Samuel Alito, who has openly opposed abortion rights for decades, led the charge against Rikelman. </p>", "<p>Why should the clinic be allowed to sue on behalf of its patients, he asked, suggesting that there is a \"conflict of interest\" with those patients.</p>", "<p>Rikelman replied that the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a plaintiff directly regulated by a law \u2014 as abortion providers are here \u2014 can challenge that law. </p>", "<p>\"Really,\" replied Alito, his voice rising. \"That's amazing!\" </p>", "<p>But, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg interjected, is there, in fact, any conflict between doctors and patients here?</p>", "<p>\"No ... This court already held that admitting privileges served no medical benefit,\" answered Rikelman, and in fact, the trial court found it \"would harm the health of women in Louisiana.\" Indeed, she said, \"even the federal government\" itself has found admitting privilege requirements to be \"medically unnecessary\" and burdensome, leading it to eliminate the requirement nationally for doctors performing outpatient surgical procedures on Medicaid and Medicare patients. </p>", "<p>Moreover, said  Rikelman,  admitting privileges do not improve the standard of care for most women seeking abortions, particularly the 40% of women seeking abortions who do not have surgery, but use abortion pills instead. </p>", "<p>Alito moved on to the facts in the case, seeking to show that the doctors at the clinics simply did not try hard enough to get admitting privileges.</p>", "<p>Dr. Doe 3, he noted, did in fact have admitting privileges. Rikelman replied that he has those privileges, but they require that he admits at least 50 patients a year to the hospital. Doe 3, said Rikelman, can only meet that requirement because of his separate private practice delivering babies.</p>", "<p>Alito moved on: Wasn't the Hope Medical Clinic \"suspended for regulatory violations?\"</p>", "<p>\"It was ... briefly in 2010,\" answered Rikelman, but after a court hearing the judge found the clinic had \"an excellent safety record.\" </p>", "<p><strong>Admitting privileges </strong></p>", "<p>When Louisiana Solicitor General Elizabeth Murrill rose to make her argument on behalf of the state, she faced a wall of questions from the court's liberals, especially its three female justices. </p>", "<p>Ginsburg: What sense does it make to require doctors to have hospital admitting privileges within 30-miles of a clinic when most complications arise after the patient is at home, usually far away from the clinic. </p>", "<p>And what about a D&amp;C, the procedure that doctors routinely do after a miscarriage and which is virtually identical to abortion procedures \u2014 are there hospital admitting privileges attached to those?</p>", "<p>Murrill eventually conceded that such procedures, which are done in a doctor's office, do not require the doctor to have hospital admitting privileges. </p>", "<p>When Murrill argued that the admitting privileges requirement serves to ensure that doctors are properly credentialed, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked: Don't you have a medical licensing requirement in the state?</p>", "<p>Justice Elena Kagan jumped in, pointing out that the record shows that hospitals deny privileges for many reasons. The decision \"could rest on the number of patients a doctor has ... on whether a particular hospital needs more providers\" and it can even \"rest on a general  view that they don't want abortion providers in that  hospital.\" Given the discretion hospitals have when granting privileges, Kagan said, how can Louisiana argue that admitting privileges perform a credentialing function? </p>", "<p>Ginsburg jumped in, \"Is it not the fact that ... in Louisiana in order to get admitting privileges you have to admit a certain number of patients?\" And because of how safe abortion is, clinics like Hope \"will never qualify because their patients don't go to the hospital.\"</p>", "<p>Is it right, Kagan continued,that the Hope clinic has treated some 70,000 patients over the past 23 years and \"transferred only four patients ever to a hospital?\"</p>", "<p>Replied lawyer Murrill: \"Only four that they know of.\"</p>", "<p>But, \"you don't dispute that ... first trimester abortion is among the safest\" medical procedures, in fact \"far safer than childbirth?\" interjected Ginsburg. Murrill replied that regardless of safety, \"the doctor should have the qualifications to ... handle the most likely complication[s].\"</p>", "<p>Justice Stephen Breyer interjected, \"we're not going to solve this at oral argument.\" Which of the doctors is your \"best case\" for not having tried hard enough to get admitting privileges?</p>", "<p>Doe 6, answered Murill. </p>", "<p>Sotomayor, exasperated: But Doe 6 for the last 12 years has only done medical abortions with pills, not surgical abortions.

It also became a liability when she started weathering attacks, first for not having a way to pay for Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" proposal, which she supports, and then over her eventual proposal to pay for that plan. (Sanders, for his part, has not yet released a detailed plan for how he would pay for Medicare for All if he's elected.)</p>", "<p>While she was considered Sanders' top competitor among progressive voters, embracing single-payer health care and wide-scale student-debt forgiveness, in the runup to Iowa, Warren attempted to pitch herself as a unity candidate.

As the coronavirus has spread from China to other countries, anti-Asian discrimination has followed closely behind, manifesting in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/11/804750392/coronavirus-affects-bottom-line-for-businesses-in-u-s-chinatowns\">plummeting sales at Chinese restaurants</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/26/809741251/san-francisco-chinatown-affected-by-coronavirus-fears-despite-no-confirmed-cases\">near-deserted Chinatown districts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/20/us/coronavirus-racist-attacks-against-asian-americans/index.html\">racist bullying</a> against people perceived to be Chinese.  </p>", "<p>We asked our listeners whether they had experienced this kind of coronavirus-related racism and xenophobia firsthand. And judging by the volume of emails, comments and tweets we got in response, the harassment has been intense for Asian Americans across the country \u2014 regardless of ethnicity, location or age.</p>", "<p>A common theme across our responses: Public transit has been <em>really</em> hostile. Roger Chiang, who works in San Francisco, recalled a white woman glaring at him on the train to work, covering her nose and mouth. When he told her in a joking tone that he didn't have the coronavirus, she replied that she \"wasn't racist \u2014 she just didn't want to get sick.\"</p>", "<p>Allison Park from Brooklyn told us that when visiting D.C., she saw a man making faces at her on the Metro train. She tried to move away from him, but he wouldn't stop. After a while, she said, he confronted her outright, saying: \"Get out of here. Go back to China. I don't want none of your swine flu here.\" A week later, on a Muni train in San Francisco, another man yelled the same thing to her \u2014 \"Go back to China\" \u2014 and even threatened to shoot her. </p>", "<p>Even a single cough or sneeze can trigger harassment. Amy Jiravisitcul from Boston said a man on a bus muttered about \"diseased Chinese people\" when she sneezed into her sleeve. When she confronted him, he told her: \"Cover your fucking mouth.\" When South San Franciscan Diane Tran sneezed into her elbow in a hallway in a hospital, where she was getting a flu shot, she said a middle-aged white woman yelled a racist slur at her.</p>", "<p>Children have been targeted, too \u2014 by other children and adults alike. Devin Cabanilla, from Seattle, told us that a Costco food sample vendor told his Korean wife and mixed-race son to \"get away\" from the samples, questioning whether they had come from China. <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-kid-turned-away-food-samples-at-costco-2020-1\">Company executives later apologized</a> to his family, but he's still shaken. \"It just reminds me that when people look at us, they don't see us as American,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Thirteen-year-old Sara Aalgaard told us that since the outbreak, many middle-school classmates of hers have been targeting the small population of Asian Americans at her school in Middletown, Conn. \"People call us 'corona,' \" she said, or ask if they eat dogs. Rebecca Wen from North Brunswick, N.J., told us that her 9-year-old son reported that his 11-year-old classmate said: \"You're Chinese, so you must have the coronavirus.\"</p>", "<p>The anti-Asian harassment isn't limited to the U.S., either. International outlets have reported harassment in majority-white countries like Australia, where parents in Melbourne<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/sensationalist-media-is-exacerbating-racist-coronavirus-fears-we-need-to-combat-it\"> refused to let Asian doctors treat their children</a>, and Canada, where around 10,000 Toronto-area people signed a petition <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/chinese-canadians-denounce-rising-xenophobia-tied-coronavirus-200202191216923.html\">calling for the local school district to track and isolate Chinese-Canadian students</a> who may have traveled to China for the Lunar New Year.</p>", "<p>In Germany, Thea Suh said that when she sat down on her train to work, the person sitting next to turned away from her and covered his face. A few days later, a woman told her to move her \"corona-riddled body\" elsewhere. Not once did someone step in to help, she said. \"I have also not seen or heard any German politician or major influencer coming to our defenses,\" she said. \"And I feel like as a part of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks\">model minority</a>, we are being left alone.\"</p>", "<p>That's another common theme from the responses we got: Witnesses and bystanders were slow to intervene. Allison Park remembers that when the man on the D.C. Metro told her to go back to China, the train was nearly two-thirds full, but no one said anything. At best, she got some sympathetic looks. Amy Jiravisitcul said that the other passengers ignored the yelling, which made her wonder whether they thought she was just making a scene.</p>", "<p>And when the harassment has passed, unease still lingers. Jane Hong from New York told us that when she and a fellow Korean American were walking from lunch, she heard a man screaming \"yuck\" in their direction. Now, she notices whenever people on the street look at her for more than a passing glance.</p>", "<p>\"I don't know if 'paranoid' is the word,\" Hong said. \"Now it's in my head. I wonder if they are thinking, 'I have to stay away from her, I don't want to walk near her.' Now that the seed has been planted in my head, it's hard to not have that thought cross my mind.\"</p>", "<p><em>For more on xenophobia and coronavirus, </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch\">listen to this week's episode of the Code Switch podcast</a><em>.

For now, Bloomberg is scheduled to campaign in Michigan on Thursday ahead of the state's March 10 primary.</p>", "<p>Sheekey made clear that Bloomberg's pledge to spend more of his fortune to elect a Democrat stands, noting that if Bloomberg did not become the nominee, he would become \"the most important person to whomever that candidate will be.\"</p>", "<p>That commitment also holds if the nominee is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sheekey said. \"They agree on something that's really important, which is this president has to be removed from office,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Bloomberg spent more than $500 million in just 100 days on his own campaign. With a fortune estimated around $60 billion, he could do it again for someone else without breaking a financial sweat, helping state parties and supporting efforts to identify and turn out voters in November.

Bernie Sanders went into Super Tuesday the front-runner, but it was Joe Biden's night. The former vice president rode a surge of momentum out of his <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810477647/biden-wins-south-carolina-primary-ap-projects\">big win in South Carolina</a> on Saturday and established himself squarely as the principal alternative to Sanders.</p>", "<p>Biden won a majority of states, including Texas, Tuesday night. Sanders is projected to win California, but with votes still being counted there it's unclear which candidate will emerge with a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/799979293/how-many-delegates-do-the-2020-presidential-democratic-candidates-have\">delegate lead</a>.</p>", "<p>That sets up what looks to be a sharp fight over the next two months between candidates with very different ideologies \u2014 Sanders paints in bold colors and wants radical change; Biden believes in progress accomplished by working with Washington's competing interests.</p>", "<p>\"We are not only taking on the corporate establishment, we are taking on the political establishment,\" Sanders said before rattling off a list of differences with Biden.</p>", "<p>Later, an ebullient Biden swatted at Sanders. \"People are talking about a revolution,\" he said. \"We started a movement.\"</p>", "<p>Here are five takeaways on why Biden did so well on Super Tuesday and where the race stands now:</p>", "<p><strong>1. Biden and Sanders have distinctly different bases of support</strong></p>", "<p>Exit polling revealed Biden \"did well with moderates and conservatives, voters older than 45 and African Americans,\" according to The Associated Press. In Alabama, for example, Biden won nearly 70% of African American voters, who are a majority of the state's Democratic electorate.</p>", "<p>Sanders showed strength with liberal voters, Latinos and voters younger than 30, according to the AP. In California, Sanders won nearly half the Latino vote \u2014 double Biden's share \u2014 which makes up 30% of the state's voters.</p>", "<p>Black and Latino voters are pillars of the Democratic Party. Whoever becomes the nominee needs to have their strong support.</p>", "<p>And don't forget about women. They powered Democrats' 2018 takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives. The AP reports Biden \"enjoyed an advantage among women and college graduates.\" The Biden campaign and the <a href=\"https://unitethecountry.com/\">superPAC </a>supporting him are confident that they are in particular winning over women older than 40.</p>", "<p><strong>2. Sanders' ceiling might be real</strong></p>", "<p>Sanders may have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/23/808536303/after-the-nevada-caucuses-bernie-sanders-is-the-man-to-beat\">expanded his coalition in the Nevada caucuses</a>, but the breadth of his support looked awfully limited on Super Tuesday. It's hard to see how he regains his momentum and expands beyond his loyal base after Tuesday night.</p>", "<p>Going on TV and talking about how he's running against the Democratic Party establishment makes it hard to win over people who have proudly voted Democratic for a long time. Even if Sanders doesn't need establishment party leaders, he needs the party's loyal voters. Sanders has done very little to mollify and reach out to them.</p>", "<p>Biden clearly picked up support from many of those kinds of voters after Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropped out and endorsed him.</p>", "<p>Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg's campaign manager told reporters the campaign will assess the results Wednesday (Bloomberg's only Super Tuesday victory was in American Samoa). If Bloomberg were to also endorse Biden, Biden's support could expand further.</p>", "<p>Sanders' hope has to be that he gets a boost from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who had another disappointing night, finishing third behind Biden and Sanders in her home state. But she did gain delegates in almost half a dozen states Tuesday night.</p>", "<p>Warren hasn't shown much sign of giving up the fight and has already traveled to post-Super Tuesday states. There will likely be pressure on her from progressives to back out and support Sanders.</p>", "<p><strong>3. Young voters are not coming out in droves</strong></p>", "<p>\"We are going to defeat Trump because we are putting together an unprecedented grassroots, multigenerational, multiracial movement,\" Sanders said Tuesday night.</p>", "<p>But Sanders' actual younger-than-30 turnout isn't quite living up to that promise. While Sanders is winning big margins among young voters, they aren't making up significantly higher shares of the electorate than in past elections.</p>", "<p>Before Tuesday, voters younger than 30 were not keeping pace with the overall increase in voter turnout. In fact, young voters' share of the electorate went down in three of the first four states compared with 2016.</p>", "<p>On Tuesday night, not a single state saw an increase in young voters' share of the electorate, according to exit polls conducted by <a href=\"https://www.edisonresearch.com/\">Edison Research</a> and sponsored by several of the television networks.</p>", "<p><strong>4. This campaign has already changed a lot \u2014 could it change again?</strong></p>", "<p>Biden appears to be favored in some big <a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/elections20-primaries/\">upcoming contests</a>, including Florida on March 17 and Georgia a week later.</p>", "<p>But polls have defined four different leaders at various times during this race. Biden has a reputation for being undisciplined, and his continued success is certainly a wild card.</p>", "<p>A shift like the one that occurred this Super Tuesday, though, is unprecedented, and it may very well be that all those voters \u2014 three-quarters in most polls \u2014 who have said they could change their minds may have made them up.</p>", "<p>If that's the case, that would give Biden the inside track to the nomination.</p>", "<p><strong>5. Momentum still trumps money in presidential primaries</strong></p>", "<p>No one in modern history has been able to ignore the first four state contests and win the nomination. Bloomberg had a plausible theory of how to do it \u2014 namely spending $500 million on his campaign.</p>", "<p>But guess what? Hard-won momentum clearly trumped money. Voters were at first open to Bloomberg, but his debate performances doomed him. His favorability ratings tanked, so much so that majorities of Democratic voters said they had unfavorable opinions of Bloomberg in exit polls, while they had very favorable opinions of Biden, Sanders and Warren.</p>", "<p>It's not clear which states will go first in the next presidential nominating season, but it's pretty likely no candidate will ever again try what Bloomberg did in bypassing the early states. If a guy with his kind of money spent this kind of fortune and came up short, it's unlikely anyone will try it again.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

In that case, Texas argued that admitting privileges, which allow doctors  to admit and care for their patients in hospitals, would protect the health and safety of women seeking abortions.</p>", "<p>The justices, however, concluded that rather than protecting women's health, these requirements simply created unconstitutional obstacles to abortion access by making it difficult or impossible to staff abortion clinics.</p>", "<p>Before the court is a Louisiana admitting privileges law that the state concedes is identical to the Texas law.</p>", "<p><strong>The state law at the heart of the case</strong></p>", "<p>Louisiana passed its law in 2014, before the Supreme Court ruled the Texas statute unconstitutional. Prior to that, the state required abortion clinics to have transfer agreements with hospitals so that if patients needed hospital attention, they could be easily transferred. The 2014 law upped the ante, requiring that abortion clinic doctors have admitting privileges at hospitals, privileges that most hospitals will not grant to doctors who don't provide the hospital with a steady stream of patients.</p>", "<p>A federal district court judge struck down the law, finding the admitting privileges requirement as unnecessary in Louisiana as it had been in Texas. The judge said that because abortion is among the safest procedures today, it is unusual for patients to ever be admitted to a hospital. And, he noted, in the \"extremely rare\" cases in which complications do arise, patients are treated by hospital staff.</p>", "<p>The judge further found that the barriers to abortion doctors getting admitting privileges were so high that were the law allowed to go into effect, only one clinic and one abortion doctor in the state would be able to perform abortions \u2014 a situation that would in no way meet the needs of the 10,000 women who seek abortions in Louisiana each year.</p>", "<p>But the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which had been overruled in the Texas case, reinstated the Louisiana law and allowed it to go into effect.  The Supreme Court \u2014 on a split 5-4 vote \u2014 intervened to temporarily block the law, and now the justices are taking a second look.</p>", "<p>Louisiana is essentially relitigating the issue decided in the Texas case four years ago. But now, the composition of the Supreme Court is different.</p>", "<p>In the Texas case, the fifth and decisive vote was cast by Kennedy, who has since been replaced by Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed by President Trump. And Kavanaugh has already indicated his willingness to undermine the Texas ruling \u2014 he was among the four justices who voted to leave the Louisiana law in place.</p>", "<p><strong>Admitting privileges </strong></p>", "<p>Even though the law has not gone into effect, Louisiana argues that requiring admitting privileges for abortion providers really would make women safer.</p>", "<p>\"If you have a good doctor and a competent doctor, it is better for you ... to have some continuity of care and not to just be sent to the hospital,\" says Louisiana Solicitor General Elizabeth Murrill.</p>", "<p>\n                The Hope Medical Group for Women<em><strong> </strong></em>in Shreveport, La., is at the center of the case before the Supreme Court on Wednesday.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">The Hope Medical Group for Women<em><strong> </strong></em>in Shreveport, La., is at the center of the case before the Supreme Court on Wednesday.</p>", "<p>But every major medical group in the country \u2014 from the American Medical Association to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u2014 contradicts that assertion. Indeed, although the Trump administration is backing Louisiana in this case, the federal government itself recently eliminated admitting privilege requirements for doctors who treat Medicare and Medicaid patients at outpatient surgical centers. The federal government found admitting privilege requirements to be burdensome and unnecessary.</p>", "<p>In reality, a decision to grant admitting privileges is largely a business decision for hospitals. Doctors are not generally granted privileges unless they routinely admit significant numbers of patients for treatment. For instance, doctors who regularly deliver babies in hospitals are good candidates for admitting privileges.</p>", "<p>Abortion providers, on the other hand, are not. Abortion has such a low complication rate \u2014 nationally, it is less than a quarter of 1% \u2014 that providers do not regularly admit patients to hospitals. What's more, without the financial incentive of regular hospital \"admits,\" there is even less reason for a hospital to grant privileges to doctors whose practice brings with it controversy and security risks.</p>", "<p>Abortion is a hot-button issue in Louisiana, and doctors providing abortions in the state face extreme pressure.</p>", "<p>One doctor \"was outed as an abortion provider and protesters showed up at [his] children's school,\" says Julie Rikelman, who represents the Hope Medical Group for Women<em><strong> </strong></em>in Shreveport, a clinic that provides abortion services.</p>", "<p>Even hospitals that have already granted privileges to doctors don't \"want to be identified by name,\" says Rikelman. </p>", "<p>Louisiana, however, contends that none of this is really an obstacle for competent doctors. It says that four of the state's six abortion clinic doctors simply did not act in good faith when seeking to obtain hospital admitting privileges. In short, it says, if the doctors had really tried, they could have complied with the state's requirement. </p>", "<p>Rikelman sees that assertion as absurd. <strong> </strong></p>", "<p>Before the law went into effect, one \"doctor who actually was an assistant clinical professor at [Louisiana State University] for 18 years and contacted LSU\" about obtaining privileges and was told, \"Sorry,  now that you're a full-time abortion provider, the hospital doesn't want to do that,\" says Rikelman.</p>", "<p>Rikelman will tell the justices that even the 5th Circuit conceded it could not identify a single woman who would have been better off because of the admitting privileges law.</p>", "<p><strong>A question of legal standing</strong></p>", "<p>Still, there is one new twist in Wednesday's case. For the first time, Louisiana, and the Trump administration, are claiming that doctors and clinics do not have the legal standing to challenge an abortion law on behalf of their patients.</p>", "<p>\"The doctors who are seeking to have less oversight and reduce regulations upon them do not share the same interests as women,\" Louisiana Solicitor General Murrill said of the doctors and clinics who bring lawsuits on behalf of their patients.</p>", "<p>For more than 40 years, the Supreme Court has recognized the rights of doctors to challenge abortion laws, not just on behalf of themselves, but on behalf of their patients, too.</p>", "<p>\"If you're a patient in Louisiana and you're struggling to find abortion care, all you know is that the clinic on the other end of the phone can't see you,\" says T.J. Tu, a senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. \"You might not know the reason you are not being seen. The people who know that are the physicians in the clinics themselves, which is why they're allowed to come to court and raise their patients rights.\"</p>", "<p>In short, abortion providers see this new procedural challenge as a backdoor way to prevent future challenges to anti-abortion-rights laws, or a wolf in sheep's clothing.</p>", "<p>\"The wolf is the doctors,\" counters Murrill. \"These are not safe places. Women are exposed to dangerous situations at these clinics, and I do think they could enhance the quality of care.\"</p>", "<p>No court has found that the Hope clinic in Shreveport, which is at the center of Wednesday's case, to be unsafe. It has long provided about 3,000 abortions a year, and the district court found that in the past 23 years, only four patients had to be transferred to a hospital because of a complication.</p>", "<p>In the short run, this case is about the availability of abortion in Louisiana. In the early 2000s, there were 11 abortion clinics in the state. Today, there are three, and if the state prevails, it is unclear whether all three could survive. Based on the evidence to date, only two of the six doctors currently providing abortions in the state would be able to continue to do so. And one of those has said he would retire under those circumstances.</p>", "<p>Until then, Hope emphasizes that it will continue to provide abortions in Louisiana.</p>", "<p>\"I do this ... because the women deserve good compassionate care,\" says Kathleen Pittman, director of the Hope clinic. \"And we're going to provide it as long as we possibly can. And we're not going to go quietly into the night.\"</p>", "<p>In the long run, of course, this case is about much more than Louisiana. It is about the right to abortion in the United States and the decades-long effort by abortion opponents to overturn Roe v. Wade. A decision by the court in favor of Louisiana would be a first big step in that direction.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

He was ultimately released by Cuba in exchange for the U.S. government releasing three Cubans convicted of spying.</p>", "<p>The congressional delegation visited Gross in Cuba in 2014 to press for his release.</p>", "<p>Gross said Heitkamp and Tester brought him a big bag of peanut M&amp;M's, a memory that Gross remains fond of today because of his undernourishment at the time. Sanders brought an issue of <em>The Atlantic</em> magazine. Gross was also allowed to wear civilian clothes for the visit \u2014 a treat because normally he was allowed to wear only prison pajamas.</p>", "<p>He said he had a pleasant conversation with Heitkamp and Tester, while Sanders remained mostly quiet for the duration of their one-hour meeting.</p>", "<p>\"Senator Sanders didn't really engage much in the conversation,\" Gross said.</p>", "<p>But near the end, the Vermont senator offered a comment to the detained American, saying he didn't see what was so wrong with the country.</p>", "<p>Gross, as a prisoner in that country, said he took offense to the remark.</p>", "<p>\"I just think, you know, it was a stupid thing for him to do,\" Gross told NPR. \"First, how could he not have seen the incredible deterioration of what was once the grandeur of the pre-Castro era.

In fact, thus far, results show that she will likely exit Super Tuesday <em>still </em>not having placed in the top two anywhere \u2014 including her home state of Massachusetts. </p>", "<p>What appeared to be a narrow path to victory going into Super Tuesday now appears practically impossible. </p>", "<p>Warren is now hundreds of delegates behind the front-runners, Biden and Sanders. She exits Super Tuesday with just <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/799979293/how-many-delegates-do-the-2020-presidential-democratic-candidates-have\">50 delegates</a>.

You know, pundits, friends, neighbors are all saying you have to second-guess yourself on this,\" she said. \"But prediction has been a terrible business and the pundits have gotten it wrong over and over.\"</p>", "<p>Warren had signaled that she intends to keep going in this race. On Tuesday night, she announced that she is planning to return to Michigan later this week and also hold events in Arizona and Idaho, seeming to signal that she isn't giving up. Michigan and Idaho hold their primaries on March 10, with Arizona following a week later.</p>", "<p>And indeed, over the weekend, her campaign had <a href=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/super-tuesday-and-beyond-64c138196562\">released a memo</a> saying she was pinning her hopes on the Democratic convention in July, banking on no candidate winning an outright majority of delegates.</p>", "<p>Warren now occupies an awkward middle ground in the presidential race. On the one hand, she has amassed a large and enthusiastic base of support that promotes her ardently on social media and fills events; her campaign reports that she drew more than 3,000 people in Los Angeles on Monday night and 2,200 in Detroit on Tuesday.</p>", "<p>However, none of that has proved enough to present a major challenge in the delegate race.</p>", "<p>Perhaps another illustration of Warren's difficult position is that she was the first-place, second-choice candidate in the latest <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Wednesday-Release_NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_2002171446.pdf\">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll</a>.

There are plenty of reasons to hide under the covers. But she's a reason to get out of bed.\"</p>", "<p>Tuesday night in Michigan, some of Warren's supporters were hanging on, but less cheerfully.</p>", "<p>\"I would like to say I'm optimistic, but to be honest, the American people consistently disappoint me, so I'm not that optimistic,\" said Yvie Siferd, an attorney from the Detroit area. \"But I am hanging on to a little bit of hope.\"</p>", "<p>\"Same.

Bloomberg finished a distant third in the state after pouring more than <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/811245436/bloomberg-bets-500-million-on-super-tuesday-wins-talks-about-convention-deal\">$500 million </a>of his personal fortune in campaign ads across all 15 Super Tuesday contests.</p>", "<p>Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/811245436/bloomberg-bets-500-million-on-super-tuesday-wins-talks-about-convention-deal\">suspended his campaign </a>Wednesday and endorsed Biden, who he called \"my friend and a great American.\"  </p>", "<p>For Biden, Texas, the night's second-largest haul with 228 delegates, proved that momentum may be more of a contributing factor in a race then money or organization. As NPR Politics Editor Amita Kelly pointed out during <a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/liveblogs/20200303-super-tuesday/\">NPR's election night analysis</a>, Biden only spent around $89,000 in Texas. </p>", "<p>\n                Voters wait in line to cast their ballots during the presidential primary in Houston, Texas on Super Tuesday, March 3.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Mark Felix/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Voters wait in line to cast their ballots during the presidential primary in Houston, Texas on Super Tuesday, March 3.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Sanders, the only other candidate poised to challenge Biden for the Democratic nomination, spent more than $3.7 million in the state. </p>", "<p>It's not all bad for Sanders though. With more than 90% of Texas precincts reporting, Biden holds a less than 4-point lead over Sanders, according to The Associated Press, which means both candidates will be awarded delegates.   </p>", "<p>That split in delegates also holds true in the night's largest prize, California. While Sanders won the state, the self-described Democratic socialist did not win by a wide enough margin to keep the former vice president from claiming his share of delegates.  </p>", "<p>Biden's Tuesday night performance can be described as nothing short of phenomenal. </p>", "<p>In the 72 hours between his commanding victory Saturday in the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810477647/biden-wins-south-carolina-primary-ap-projects\">South Carolina primary</a> and the Super Tuesday contests, Biden was able to consolidate endorsements from former presidential rivals, Pete Buttgieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke. </p>", "<p>Biden was also able to demonstrate his widespread support among African American voters, a core constituency in the Democratic Party, but one that did not factor in early contents in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/805315636/iowa-state-election-results-2020\">Iowa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/805322930/new-hampshire-state-election-results-2020\">New Hampshire</a>. Biden placed a distant fourth and fifth respectively in those states.  </p>", "<p>As NPR's Juana Summers <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811942583/who-different-groups-supported-on-super-tuesday\">reported</a>, Biden outperformed Sanders with black voters in Texas, where they make up about one-fifth of the Democratic primary electorate. According to exit polls, Biden had the support of roughly 60% of black voters in the state; Sanders had 17%. (Sanders led among Latino voters in the state.)</p>", "<p>Biden won the largest counties in Texas despite <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/election-2020/2020/03/03/362534/super-tuesday-plagued-by-hours-long-wait-times-in-parts-of-harris-county/\">long wait times and technical issues </a>marring the experience for some voters.</p>", "<p data-pym-loader data-child-src=\"https://apps.npr.org/elections20-primaries/embeds/?live=&amp;race=P&amp;data=TX_P_3_3_2020&amp;party=Dem&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.npr.org%2Felections20-primaries%2Fstates%2FTX.html\" id=\"responsive-embed-TX-P-332020-\"> Loading... </p>", "<p>Houston Public Media reported that Harris County, which includes Houston, had 52 fewer polling places than in previous elections, and those closures disproportionately impact communities of color. </p>", "<p>Still, Biden was able to carry Harris County by more than 8 points, as well as Dallas County and Tarrant County, which includes the city of Fort Worth, by slightly smaller margins. The former vice president carried Jefferson County, which includes the city of Beaumont, by a more than 2-to-1 margin 48.4 percent to Sanders 19.7 percent. </p>", "<p>With those victories, Biden now pulls ahead in the overall delegate count, leading Sanders 566 to 501. </p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}
