Doctors in Italy are making difficult decisions on who should receive care.</p>", "<p>As COVID-19 spreads rapidly through the United States, many American doctors could soon be making the decisions that overwhelmed health care workers in Italy are already facing: Which patients get life-saving treatment and which ones do not?</p>", "<p>Every accredited hospital in the U.S. is required to have some mechanism for addressing ethical issues like this \u2014 typically, an ethics committee made up of not just medical professionals, but often also social workers, pastors and patient advocates. Sometimes in partnership with hospital triage committees, they create guidelines for prioritizing patient care if there's a resource shortage.</p>", "<p>As the number of coronavirus cases rises in the U.S., hospitals have a new urgency in revisiting and updating those guidelines. </p>", "<p>They vary from hospital to hospital, but their overall goal is usually to save the most lives. So hospitals consider a combination of factors: age, life expectancy, how severe a patient's illness is, how likely treatment is to help, and whether a patient has additional illnesses that could shorten their life span, such as cancer or heart disease. Hospitals can then use those factors to develop scoring systems or clinical scores to prioritize care.</p>", "<p>In early March, as the coronavirus outbreak worsened in Italy, an Italian medical association issued guidelines finding that doctors might have to prioritize younger COVID-19 patients over older ones. \"It may be necessary to place an age limit\" on access to intensive care, the guidelines advised, with the goal of preserving limited health care resources for patients more likely to survive.</p>", "<p>But age is rarely the only factor in such decision making. For example, a 20-year-old will not always get priority over a 60-year-old, especially if that 20-year-old has additional health problems that could mean the 60-year-old is likely to live longer anyway. Scoring systems can disadvantage older patients because as people age they become more susceptible to disease, which can hurt their clinical scores.</p>", "<p>Another potential factor is \"social usefulness,\" a concept that might favor, for example, a sick nurse because that person could go on to save other lives.</p>", "<p>\"Some people think that people who are in a position to help address a crisis in the future if they were to recover, like health care workers and first responders, maybe should receive some sort of priority in triaging scarce resources,\" said Dr. Emily Rubin, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a co-chair of the hospital's ethics committee.</p>", "<p>Could other professions also be a factor, meaning that a hospital might prioritize, say, a hedge fund manager over a landscaper? That's unlikely, according to Dr. Matthew Wynia, an infectious disease and public health specialist who directs the University of Colorado's Center for Bioethics and Humanities.</p>", "<p>Wynia said most hospitals should operate on the principle that every human life has equal worth, so patients are clinically evaluated the same regardless of their employment, gender, race, insurance or whether they have children.</p>", "<p>\"So if you had someone who was an upstanding member of the local community or a big donor to the hospital or a well-known politician versus a clerk at the 7-Eleven or a homeless person,\" Wynia said, each of those patients should be evaluated equally.</p>", "<p>There's already <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-testing-elite.html\">evidence</a> when it comes to coronavirus testing that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-testing-elite.html\">rich and powerful</a> people are getting greater access than ordinary Americans.</p>", "<p>But ideally, hospital decision-makers would have \"blinded\" information that prevents them from knowing details about a patient's source of payment, race, gender and other personal details, unless it's clinically relevant, Wynia said. </p>", "<p>Hospitals could adopt a lottery or first-come-first-served system for triaging patients, but that might mean someone less sick is treated before someone more sick, potentially failing to achieve the goal of saving the most lives. Hospitals could treat worse-off patients first, but if those people are unlikely to survive, doctors might be better off focusing on people who are less ill.</p>", "<p>Whether any of these guidelines would work in an extreme crisis situation, when hospitals may have few clinical details about patients, is an open question.</p>", "<p>\"A million intricacies\" could come into play in a real-world setting, Rubin said. </p>", "<p>Numerous doctors interviewed by NPR said the U.S. lacks an exact historical comparison for how the coronavirus pandemic could play out, but said guidelines at least offer general principles for steering hospital decision-making.</p>", "<p>They also said guidelines must be transparent so the public has faith they are fair and ethically justifiable. Wynia predicts many hospitals will soon begin releasing their triage guidelines in case the U.S. ends up in an Italy-like situation.</p>", "<p>And guidelines are needed not just for determining which patients to treat, but how long to treat them. Nancy Berlinger, a research scholar at the nonprofit bioethics think tank the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y., posed an ethical dilemma.</p>", "<p>\"Let's say a patient is on a ventilator but isn't improving, and this patient might \u2014 might \u2014 do better if they were allowed to stay on the ventilator longer, but there are people waiting for that ventilator,\" Berlinger said. \"Do you withdraw the ventilation earlier than you might normally do? So it's not just who gets the vent, it's also who stays on it.\"</p>", "<p>For now, U.S. hospitals are unsure whether their triage guidelines will be needed in the coronavirus pandemic, but they must brace for the possibility.</p>", "<p>\"This is a worst-case scenario that we're talking about,\" Wynia said. \"We hope we never get there, but we have to get ready for the worst. And it would be irresponsible not to be getting ready right now because of what we're seeing in other places around the world where things really have gone very, very badly and where they have run out of equipment, supplies, staff, space, people. So we need to be prepared for that.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Authorities in the U.S. and other countries have banned or discouraged large gatherings and are urging social distancing and frequent hand-washing.</p>", "<p>To answer this week's questions, we spoke with <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/albert_ko/\">Albert Ko</a> at the Yale School of Public Health and others for guidance. </p>", "<p><strong>I heard that the U.K. was talking about using a \"herd immunity\" approach to the coronavirus. What exactly is herd immunity, and could it work against coronavirus?</strong></p>", "<p>Last week, the U.K. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world \u2014 in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1238390547783528448\">develop </a>a \"herd immunity\" that would eventually end the epidemic. </p>", "<p>Herd immunity occurs<strong> </strong>when enough people in a population are immune to disease \u2014 either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. The idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected.</p>", "<p>Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1238390547783528448\">said </a>that about 60% of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect. </p>", "<p>But using such an approach would raise a big question: During that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups \u2013 the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions? </p>", "<p>Herd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists.<strong> </strong>But the idea that the U.K. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in Italy, stirred an immediate public backlash.</p>", "<p>The government quickly backtracked, and on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">would close</a> for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission.</p>", "<p>And there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. That approach \"assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. And we don't know that as of yet,\" says <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/albert_ko/\">Albert Ko</a>, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health. </p>", "<p><strong>People who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride? </strong></p>", "<p>The White House coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20_coronavirus-guidance_8.5x11_315PM.pdf\">guidelines</a> for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding \"discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,\" as well as \"social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.\"<strong> </strong>But outdoor exercise is not on the list.</p>", "<p>So unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed \u2013 though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html\">to spread</a> primarily through close contact between people \u2013 within about six feet.</p>", "<p>The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets. </p>", "<p>There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. \"So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.\"</p>", "<p>Ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.</p>", "<p>\"My personal feeling is that if people are practicing sound respiratory hygiene, sound hand hygiene, they're distancing themselves physically from others outside, and you're exercising and walking in the park \u2014 I think that's actually a good public health practice.\"</p>", "<p><strong>I've heard that taking drugs like ibuprofen to ease COVID-19 symptoms could actually worsen the progress of the illness. Is that true?</strong></p>", "<p>The World Health Organization and many infectious disease experts say that there is no good scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of COVID\u201119.</p>", "<p>The notion that such a link exists was sparked last weekend when a tweet by the French health minister warned people not to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \u2014 a category of pain relievers and fever reducers that includes ibuprofen \u2014 because, he said, some French COVID-19 patients had experienced serious side effects. The warning was also<a href=\"https://dgs-urgent.sante.gouv.fr/dgsurgent/inter/detailsMessageBuilder.do?id=30500&amp;cmd=visualiserMessage\"> included in a bulletin</a> from the French health ministry, which counseled that patients should instead use acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol.<strong> </strong></p>", "<p>But experts say that warning isn't based on data.</p>", "<p>\"Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen,\" the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1240409217997189128\">WHO stated on its official Twitter account</a>, adding, \"'We are also consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known side effects that limit its use in certain populations.\"</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/angela-rogers\">Dr. Angela Rogers</a>, a pulmonologist at the Stanford University Medical Center and chair of its intensive care unit's COVID-19 task force, notes that Tylenol is the go-to medication for patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized for any infection. That's because these patients are at higher risk of damage to internal organs, including kidneys. And<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/11/13/501033431/safety-of-painkiller-celebrex-affirmed-in-new-study\"> kidney damage can be a side effect </a>of ibuprofen for some patients who use it long-term in higher doses, says Rogers, whose research focuses on the kind of acute respiratory distress experienced by the most severe COVID-19 cases.</p>", "<p>Tylenol, like any medicine, isn't risk-free either; Rogers notes that acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage in high doses. In low doses, though, she says, Tylenol is \"very effective\" for reducing fever and \"very safe.\"</p>", "<p><strong>How do I manage any risks while grocery shopping?</strong></p>", "<p>With new research that suggests the new coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/14/811609026/the-new-coronavirus-can-live-on-surfaces-for-2-3-days-heres-how-to-clean-them\">can live on surfaces for hours or days</a>, the prospect of going grocery shopping can seem daunting. </p>", "<p>But you can manage the risk.</p>", "<p>First of all, the viability<strong> </strong>of the virus goes down over time and it's sensitive to temperature \u2013 so it dies off more quickly in room temperature than it does in the cold.</p>", "<p>Second, when you go to a grocery store, people aren't generally touching all the cans on the shelf \u2014 although there tends to be more handling of individual items in the produce section.</p>", "<p>Among the things you can do to protect yourself and others are:</p>", "<p>Ko says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier. </p>", "<p>When it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.</p>", "<p>\"There's never anything that has zero risk,\" Ko says, \"but the risk is so much lower than [surfaces] that are more frequently touched.\" </p>", "<p><em>NPR's Geoff Brumfiel and Scott Neuman contributed to this report.</em></p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Sincerely, public health services.\"</p>", "<p>It's part of a sweeping new program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the country's Shin Bet domestic spy agency, usually tasked with monitoring Palestinian and Israeli extremists, to launch the cellphone surveillance. It locates people who could have the virus and messages them.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, late Thursday Israel's Supreme Court stopped the police from using the data to enforce quarantines, which it had started doing.

Now, officials use cellphone tracking going back two weeks and send the text messages to people who crossed paths with the virus.</p>", "<p>Netanyahu's Cabinet approved the surveillance measures in the middle of the night Monday, circumventing a parliamentary oversight committee still debating whether they were justified.</p>", "<p>The Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians said a lack of transparency about the surveillance program hurt public trust.

Is COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, pretty much similar to the flu or does it pose a far greater threat? </p>", "<p>Although there are still many unknowns about COVID-19, there is some solid information from researchers that sheds light on some of the similarities and differences at this time.</p>", "<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>", "<p>Fever, dry cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. These are the most frequent symptoms of COVID-19. Some patients might develop aches and pains; just 5% get the sniffles, according to <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\">data from China</a> \u2014 indicating that COVID-19 is not usually an upper respiratory infection. </p>", "<p>These are all symptoms that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/symptoms.htm\">overlap with flu</a>. The Centers for Disease Control says that anyone who is experiencing these symptoms and who has been in direct contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, or who lives in an area where cases are circulating, should <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/COVID19-symptoms.pdf\">call their doctor</a> for advice.</p>", "<p><strong>Transmission</strong></p>", "<p>Flu and coronavirus are both thought to be spread primarily through close contact with droplets expelled from the nose and mouth of a sick person. So you can become infected by direct contact such as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek\">kissing but also by close talking with someone who's infected.</a> The CDC recommends keeping a physical distance of about six feet away from others. You can also pick up flu or coronavirus if you touch a tabletop or phone that was coughed on, but not disinfected, in the past few <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/14/811609026/the-new-coronavirus-can-live-on-surfaces-for-2-3-days-heres-how-to-clean-them\">hours or days</a>,<strong> </strong>then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. </p>", "<p>Data from China shows that each coronavirus case seems to infect around 2 to 2.5 additional people.

The average patient spreads the flu virus to about <a href=\"https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-480\">1.3 others</a>. </p>", "<p>New research suggests that the higher number of infections per coronavirus patient may be related to the frequency of presymptomatic transmission \u2014 when people who have been infected are not yet showing symptoms but in fact could be contagious. An analysis of data from China <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0357_article\">found that 13%</a> of cases were likely caused by people spreading coronavirus before they started coughing and feeling achy. </p>", "<p>By contrast, flu is most contagious in the three or four days after symptoms begin, according <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm\">to the CDC</a>, and presymptomatic transmission <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646474/\">doesn't seem to be</a> a major driver of new cases. </p>", "<p>It's also possible that coronavirus can be transmitted by other methods. Researchers are trying to determine, for example, if tiny droplets can stay suspended in the air in contagious doses, or if fecal matter can be a source of infection.</p>", "<p><strong>Degree of mild vs. severe cases</strong></p>", "<p>80% of coronavirus cases are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/814691018/coronavirus-symptoms-defining-mild-moderate-and-severe\">mild to moderate</a> \u2014 which ranges from having a fever and a cough to low-grade pneumonia. It might still be miserable, but you can heal up on your couch at home.</p>", "<p>Data from China shows that 20% of COVID-19 patients, though, are serious enough to get sent to the hospital. That's about ten times more often <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html\">than flu</a>. Even though a great many people are hospitalized for the flu \u2014 the preliminary data for the 2018-19 flu season is nearly <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html\">half a million</a> \u2014 the rate of hospitalization is far lower: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html\">1-2%</a> percent of cases, according to the CDC.<strong> </strong></p>", "<p>For coronavirus, \"what's particularly concerning are the number of people who are progressing to need hospital level care and then eventually critical care and who are dying, especially at the extremes of [older] age,\" says <a href=\"https://dellmed.utexas.edu/directory/parker-hudson\">Dr. Parker Hudson</a>, an epidemiologist at University of Texas in Austin's Dell Medical School.</p>", "<p>People who are over 60 and who have other health problems are more at risk<strong> </strong>of severe illness and hospitalization \u2014 for both COVID-19 and flu. </p>", "<p><strong>Length of hospitalization</strong></p>", "<p>Once a patient with a serious case of coronavirus is hospitalized, the average stay is 11 days, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30566-3/fulltext\">according to a study</a> based on January data from Wuhan \u2014 about twice as long as the 5-to-6 day average stay for flu.</p>", "<p>The additional days mean additional stresses on the health-care system. \"To take care of intensive, really unwell people can often require two to three medical staff at one time, all in protective gear, for hours and hours,\" says<a href=\"http://origin.who.int/about/who_reform/emergency-capacities/oversight-committee/michael-ryan/en/\"> Michael Ryan</a>, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program.</p>", "<p>That's a big strain on our nurses and doctors and hospitals, and it's overlapping with flu season, which generally ends by May. From early October through the beginning of March, the CDC estimates that between <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm\">370,000 and 670,000</a> people were hospitalized with flu. </p>", "<p><strong>What percentage of the population will get each virus?</strong></p>", "<p>There are years of data that can answer that question for influenza. In the U.S., for example, in recent years about 8.3% of the total population get sick from flu each season, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/66/10/1511/4682599\">a CDC study found</a>; including people who carry flu virus but show no symptoms, that estimate ranges to up to 20%. </p>", "<p>Nobody knows what percentage of the population will eventually contract coronavirus. But there are some educated guesses. Since this is a new disease and there's no vaccine and no established immunity from past cycles, experts believe everyone is susceptible. </p>", "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0822-7\">March 19 letter</a> from researchers at the University of Hong Kong and Harvard, published in <em>Nature Medicine</em>, predicted that globally, \"at least one-quarter to one-half of the population will very likely become infected, absent drastic control measures or a vaccine.\"</p>", "<p>An <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/17/817214311/new-analysis-suggests-months-of-social-distancing-may-be-needed-to-stop-virus\">influential modeling analysis</a> released March 16 from Imperial College of London predicted a <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">worse-case scenario</a> in which 81% of the U.S. population could get infected over the next few months, if no actions were taken to slow or contain the spread of the virus.

So far, COVID-19 has killed around 10,000 people worldwide how many people worldwide \u2014 and around 200 in the U.S. But infectious disease specialists warn that, if coronavirus spreads widely in the U.S., the numbers could rise quickly.</p>", "<p>\"It does have the potential to be just as bad, if not worse, in terms of the overall number of deaths and severe cases as seasonal flu,\" says <a href=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/center-infection-and-immunity/angela-rasmussen-phd\">Angela Rasmussen</a>, a virologist at Columbia University. </p>", "<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>", "<p>Rest and supportive care are the common treatments for both <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/treatment.htm\">flu</a> and for coronavirus cases that don't require hospitalization.</p>", "<p>For flu, which has been studied intensively, doctors have some additional tools to fight it, says <a href=\"https://www.chp.edu/health-care-professionals/education/fellowships/fellows/freeman-megan\">Dr. Meghan Freeman</a>, an infectious disease fellow at the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. A drug called Tamiflu aims to stop the flu virus from replicating in the body and can lessen the severity of symptoms. Other treatments that prime the body's<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/03/07/700796147/an-antibody-inspired-small-molecule-could-make-for-a-better-flu-treatment\"> immune system</a> are in development.</p>", "<p>There are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet, though researchers are racing to see if pills for other ailments could work against coronavirus, and to develop specific therapies that would lessen symptoms and hasten recovery. </p>", "<p>Existing medications are being evaluated in the U.S., China and other countries. \"It is likely that we will know if they work in the next several months,\" said Dr. Fauci, director of the NIAID, in <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?470224-1/dr-fauci-warns-congress-coronavirus-outbreak-worse\">congressional testimony on March 11</a>. Drugs under consideration include remdesevir, an experimental drug originally developed for Ebola, and an anti-malarial called chloroquine, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wucieL5YxCs&amp;feature=emb_title\">according to WHO</a>.</p>", "<p><strong>Vaccines</strong></p>", "<p>For vaccines that could prevent COVID-19, Dr. Fauci said it will take at least a year to a year and a half for a vaccine to be available to the public. Vaccine development requires a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/test-approve.html\">multi-stage process</a> of human trials. \"It will take three or four months to determine if [a vaccine option] is safe,\" he said, and at least another eight months to gauge whether it's effective.

This flu season, the CDC says that around 160-170 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2019-2020.htm\">million flu shots</a> were shipped out \u2014 enough to cover about half the U.S. population.</p>", "<p><strong>Impact of Seasonal Weather</strong></p>", "<p>While flu cases are found <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm\">year-round</a>, the flu does wane when the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/12/805256402/can-coronavirus-be-crushed-by-warmer-weather\">weather gets warm</a>. In the U.S., each flu season varies, but the number of new flu cases <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm\">tends to peak</a> between December and February, and tail off by the month of May. </p>", "<p>Researchers think it has to do with how people spend more time outside when it's warmer, and how higher heat and humidity can cause some viruses to decay more quickly. They're also studying how the immune system may <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604842/\">fluctuate with the seasons</a> and exposure to sunlight. </p>", "<p>But <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/adg/aylward/en/\">Dr. Bruce Aylward</a>, an adviser to WHO, says don't count on a similar pattern for COVID-19, which is thriving in warm, tropical places: \"It's roaring in Singapore. It's not flu season in Singapore. It's roaring in the southern part of China. It's not flu season.\" </p>", "<p>Researchers will only know if coronavirus follows flu patterns by seeing whether infections decline as the seasons change. There's the possibility that it won't, so in the meantime, Aylward thinks hospitals should prepare as though COVID-19 is here to stay as a year-round health threat.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Traditionally, a splash of cologne was offered to house guests and restaurant patrons to rub on their hands. In recent years, however, sales fell off. The younger generation just wasn't interested, he says.</p>", "<p>\"But now they understand that it's also a disinfectant,\" he says, \"and they're coming in to buy, too.\"</p>", "<p>In Ottoman times, Kaygin adds, cologne was a popular holiday gift, especially at the Eid holiday marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. That tradition has continued.</p>", "<p>\"I used to buy this only for Eid,\" one of his customers says, \"but now I'm back, yes, because it's also a disinfectant.\"</p>", "<p>Kaygin stocks another brand as well, but because of its lower alcohol content, he says it's not selling nearly as well.</p>", "<p><strong>A boom beyond Turkey<br></strong></p>", "<p>Last week, the Turkish government halted the requirement to include ethanol in gasoline, boosting the capacity to produce colognes and disinfectants. Turkish media have suggested that traditional use of cologne on the hands before going out may have helped keep the number of infections in the country relatively low so far.</p>", "<p>That remains pure speculation. Turkey, like everywhere else, officially urges hand washing to help protect against the coronavirus. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's traditional way of greeting visitors and guests \u2014 avoiding a handshake by placing his hand on his chest and nodding \u2014 is also recommended by the media.</p>", "<p>But there's no question cologne sales shot up as the virus began to spread.

He said his company had cut production on several other products to put all available resources into making cologne, working double shifts to turn out 12,000 bottles per day.</p>", "<p>Back in Istanbul, shop owner Kaygin says one reason people quickly moved to stock up on cologne is because the tradition never completely died out. Cologne is still offered in a number of settings \u2014 to diners at Turkish restaurants, to patients and visitors at hospitals, and at the end of a visit to someone else's home.</p>", "<p>\"So they always knew about it,\" he says, \"but now they really remember it.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Those high levels of the virus mean that the coronavirus can infect others \"the moment you start to sneeze, you start to cough,\" she says.</p>", "<p>This emerging picture of the disease may help to explain why the coronavirus appears to be spreading so rapidly. Research <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150748\">from China</a> shows it can take five or even 10 days for the first symptoms to emerge. Those in the very early stages of the disease continue to move through public places, unaware of the potential risk they pose. Even when symptoms start, they can be vague, similar to the cold and flu. Other <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32146694\">studies</a> from <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32149768\">China</a> show that some may never experience symptoms at all.<strong> </strong>\"That makes the policy of case finding and containment very challenging,\" Koopmans says.</p>", "<p>Koopmans says that the revelation came for her while trying to conduct disease surveillance in the Netherlands. Like many countries, the Netherlands initially screened patients with a history of foreign travel. But when a handful of untraceable cases appeared within the country, her team shifted strategies and began to test health care workers in the hospitals where the cases were reported. They found that many were mildly ill \u2014 and already highly infectious. </p>", "<p>\"People can have really mild complaints, just a cough, just a sore throat, and already have a lot of virus [in their system],\" she says.</p>", "<p>Alfredo Garzino-Demo, a virologist based at the University of Maryland and affiliated with the University of Padua in Italy, says this characteristic, while not uncommon among viruses, makes this disease extremely hard to contain. \"Many diseases have a window period in which you don't have symptoms but you are still able to transmit,\" he says.<strong> </strong>\"But this one is particularly serious.\" </p>", "<p>The evolving view helps explain why countries are having to resort to such extreme social distancing measures to contain the spread of the disease. It also highlights the need for broad testing of the general population, says <a href=\"https://www.inserm.fr/en/research-inserm/meet-our-researchers/inserm-prizes/marie-paule-kieny-2017-international-prize\">Marie-Paule Kieny</a>, director of research at Inserm, a French organization dedicated to the study of public health. </p>", "<p>Without broad testing, \"we can't look at the community and say what percentage of the people have had contact with the virus,\" she says. That information is crucial in determining how best to deploy economically crippling social distancing measures. </p>", "<p>\"The European countries are not testing properly,\" she says. \"I think it's not better in the U.S., by the way.\"</p>", "<p>Broad surveillance of the general population will be key to controlling subsequent waves of the disease, she warns, especially as draconian social distancing measures are loosened.</p>", "<p>The emerging science of the coronavirus is not all bad news, however. Garzino-Demo points to new, <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1\">not-yet-peer-reviewed research</a> in rhesus macaques that appears to show that the virus does not cause reinfections. That's in line with what's known about other less deadly coronaviruses, but the initial finding is still reassuring, he says. Koopmans says that based on other such diseases, mild reinfection may sometimes happen, but most people will experience the worst of it the first time around.</p>", "<p>And regarding the concern that the virus could mutate,<strong> </strong>Koopmans says that genetic analysis by her lab shows that the virus is not mutating much and not in ways that would make it even more harmful. \"There's no real obvious changes that would be of concern,\" she says. </p>", "<p>Despite the deep crisis faced by the world's public health systems, the scientists believe that the pandemic will eventually pass. Health care workers will do their best to handle the surges in illness, scientists will rush toward treatments and vaccines, and governments will try to support those in need. </p>", "<p>\"There is a lot of generosity. People are really working hard to make this thing go away, doing their part,\" Garzino-Demo says.  \"We are going to win this war.\" </p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Aided by generous government subsidies, Guan filled a sterile space in a pharmaceuticals factory he already owned with second-hand machinery to assemble the masks.

Now, it's 200,000.</p>", "<p>Currently, of the 200 million masks China makes a day, only 600,000 are N95 standard masks, used by medical personnel, according to the National Development and Reform Commission, a state planning body. Provincial regulators have granted dozens of new licenses to open additional factories capable of producing top-grade masks, including those that meet the standards for use by health-care professionals.</p>", "<p>But this ambitious effort has run into a bottleneck.</p>", "<p>Both the masks made for medical personnel and for consumer purchase require a once-obscure material called melt-blown fabric. It's an extremely fine mesh of synthetic polymer fibers that forms the critical inner filtration layer of a mask, allowing the wearer to breath while reducing the inflow of possible infectious particles.</p>", "<p>\"We're talking about fibers where one filament has a diameter of less than one micron, so we are in the nano area,\" said Markus M\u00fcller, the sales director at German company <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.reicofil.com/en/pages/company__%3B!!Iwwt!A2Rs3EZbmr0mySlEZbmmzZr8DYoUKd4qLfdJAAW33xfEmvQ8o8DpI4DZl7sR%24\">Reicofil</a>, a major provider of melt-blown machine lines.</p>", "<p>And there's now a global shortage of melt-blown fabric due to the increased demand for masks \u2014 and the difficulty in producing this material.</p>", "<p>Costing upward of 3.8 million euros ($4.23 million) apiece, the machine that creates this fabric melts down plastic material and blows it out in strands, like cotton candy, into flat sheets of melt-blown fabric for face masks and other filtration products. A similar line of machines can create a related kind of fabric, called spun-bond fabric, also used in face masks and in medical protection suits worn by health-care workers.</p>", "<p>The machines are not easy to make because of the exacting precision required, says M\u00fcller: \"You need to stretch these fibers by hot air, and [the air] needs to be in perfect condition over the width of the machine. The biggest dilemma is that many of the machines are not producing consistent quality.\"</p>", "<p>Reicofil's M\u00fcller says he gets more than four dozen requests a day, mainly from China, to buy melt-blown fabric and production lines but has to turn nearly all of them away; making a single machine line takes at least five to six months.</p>", "<p>Chinese firms <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/www.xinhuanet.com/fashion/2020-02/24/c_1125616922.htm__%3B!!Iwwt!A2Rs3EZbmr0mySlEZbmmzZr8DYoUKd4qLfdJAAW33xfEmvQ8o8DpI-ifnZOg%24\">make nearly</a> three million tons of nonwoven fabric a year, according to the China Nonwoven and Industrial Textiles Association, a state industry body.

Walking on these centuries-old cobblestones, it's hard not to think they've seen this before. It was here, along the Tiber River, that a <a href=\"https://www.sciencesource.com/archive/Rome-Plague--1656-SS2618373.html\">plague</a> broke out in 1656 that claimed more than 14,000 lives.</p>", "<p>In normal times, visitors to Rome tell me how struck they are by the near absence of police and the abundance of priests.

Roman Catholic Masses are suspended, as are weddings and funerals. But lo, this is the era of the blessed cellphone \u2014 some priests are celebrating Mass on WhatsApp.</p>", "<p>And some of Rome's churches are still sending out messages the old way. At 8 p.m. Saturday, the bells of all the churches in Trastevere rang out for 10 minutes in a sign of closeness, solidarity and prayer for all those suffering from the consequences of the virus.</p>", "<p>To record those bells, I had to venture out in the dark. I wondered: Should a cop stop me, would the Roman officer consider recording church bells a legitimate form of work? I doubt it.</p>", "<p>But I went into the unknown anyway. The only sounds of the night were ambulance sirens in the distance, and all that moved were police cars with flashing blue lights.</p>", "<p>My street is poorly lit, which for once served my purpose. I encountered no one as I moved furtively along the walls and in the shadows to Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere, were I hid in an alley behind a potted plant until 8 p.m. When I returned home, I had one of the best church bell recordings I've ever made. But I also felt as if I had violated what truly feels like a wartime curfew.</p>", "<p>While churchgoers may be consoled with the chiming of bells, more secular Italians have found a different way to exorcise the coronavirus demon.

That's what the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and many hand-washing experts recommend.</p>", "<p>Twenty seconds is a long time when you're standing at a sink. The common advice is to wash as long as it takes to sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice or the ABC song. If you don't rocket through the lyrics, you should get about 20 seconds of scrub time.</p>", "<p>Yet after you've sung \"Happy Birthday,\" oh, say, 337 times in one day, perhaps you might want some alternatives. We asked our readers what they're singing (or saying). Dozens chimed in. Here are some of their responses.</p>", "<p>\"Personally I always sing Beyonce's \"Love on Top\" chorus \u2013 who doesn't need a little more Queen Bey in their life?\" writes public librarian Molly Price. Her department at the Ashe County Public Library, Adult Services, created a series of social media posts and posters (to hang in bathrooms) that encourage handwashing and offer musical options. She says the most popular post features Dolly Parton and the chorus to \"Jolene,\" which should take you to the 20 second mark:</p>", "<p>\"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, I'm begging of you please don't take my man. Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene. Please don't take him just because you can.\"</p>", "<p>Triage nurse Phillip Flavin goes for a line from Queen three times: \"We will, we will rock you (rock you).\" Sometimes, he says, he changes it to \"We will, we will wash you.\"</p>", "<p>For those whose gaze turns heavenward, Jody Brkich suggests \"Twinkle, twinkle little star\" twice. Or perhaps adding one of the obscure verses that offer a glimmer of hope: \"When the blazing sun is gone, when he nothing shines upon, then you show your little light, twinkle, twinkle, all the night.\"</p>", "<p>It's hard to resist this \"Twinkle\" rewrite submitted by Erika Perzan: \"Twinkle, twinkle little star. Look how clean my two hands are. Around my wrists and between my thumbs, lace my fingers, I'm almost done. Twinkle, twinkle little star. Look how clean my two hands are!\" </p>", "<p>Preschool director Annely Carver wrote a rap:</p>", "<p>Corona, Corona,</p>", "<p>Don't call me on your phona.</p>", "<p>I'm washing, I'm cleansing</p>", "<p>There's no way you are messing</p>", "<p>With me-with me!</p>", "<p>I'm healthy as can be!!</p>", "<p>Corona, Corona</p>", "<p>Stay-away-from-me!!!</p>", "<p>Lugarda Cappetta suggests humming the wordless final Jeopardy theme song, which is 30 seconds but actually, 10 more seconds can't hurt! </p>", "<p>Fans of Backstreet Boys, like Karina Calderon, are opting for: Shape of My Heart: </p>", "<p>\"Looking back on the things I've done. I was trying to be someone. I played my part, kept you in the dark. Now let me show you the shape of my heart.\"</p>", "<p>D.L. Preece says that kids might enjoy a round (actually two) of \"Row, row, row your boat.\" And maybe you'll add a third round of \"row, row\" and devote it to \"scratching my palms\" to dislodge pathogens under then ails. Sherry Kohn agrees with this song choice, which she learned about as a nursing student at Columbia University.</p>", "<p>The late, great Prince gets a shout-out from Lisa Radov: \"Raspberry Beret. She wore a raspberry beret, the kind that you get at a secondhand store. Raspberry beret, and if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more. Raspberry beret. I think I love her.\"</p>", "<p>For uplift, Linda Gabriel, an occupational therapist, sings the first verse of \"This Little Light of Mine.\" \"It helps me focus on feeling positive through the day,\" she writes.</p>", "<p>Singing isn't the only solution. Susan Hollier suggests reciting the Lord's Prayer twice.</p>", "<p>And if you'd like to convert a personal favorite song into a hand-washing accompaniment, try this <a href=\"https://washyourlyrics.com/\">hand-washing lyrics generator</a>. Type in the song and artist and if it's in the database, you'll get a series of hand-washing steps with lyrics to go along with each step. I tried one of my all-time favorites, \"Respect,\" as sung by Aretha Franklin, and can't wait to start washing. </p>", "<p>But maybe I will change up the lyrics a little. The picture of a person putting hands under a spigot is printed over the opening line from \"Respect\" \u2014 \"What you want, baby I got it.\" But it's more like, \"What you got, baby I want it!\" </p>", "<p>Then again, maybe music isn't essential.

Monika Lakomy-Diep, an accountant in London, struggled last week to get a doctor to treat her daughter's allergies.</p>", "<p>\"The NHS is already stretched,\" she says, standing outside St. Thomas' Hospital across the River Thames from Big Ben. \"Getting a simple GP appointment is a miracle.\"</p>", "<p>The NHS is an institution in this country. The government created it in 1948, following the end of World War II, as part of a series of reforms to give people cradle-to-grave support. Funded by taxpayers, it provides everything from annual physicals to cancer surgery at no cost to users.</p>", "<p>For most of its existence, the health system received annual funding increases of about 4% above the inflation rate. But after the global financial crisis, the U.K. government reduced those increases to about 1.5% annually over the past decade, says <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/about-us/whos-who/siva-anandaciva\">Siva Anandaciva</a>, a chief analyst at the King's Fund, a health care think tank.</p>", "<p>The U.K.'s Conservative prime minister said last week that he hopes to push the peak of COVID-19 cases into the late spring to avoid swamping the system.</p>", "<p>\"If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases,\" <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-12-march-2020\">Johnson said</a>. \"More beds are available, and we'll have more time for medical research.\"</p>", "<p>Ron Daniels, an NHS critical care doctor, says that if the government's strategy works, the NHS will be able to cope. But if it doesn't, Daniels says, the U.K. could come to resemble parts of Italy, where more than 2,100 people have died.</p>", "<p>\"If we're unable to change public behavior and we see a rapid spread,\" Daniels says, \"then the NHS is very quickly going to find itself overwhelmed, as has happened in Lombardy,\" a northwestern Italian region that has been devastated by COVID-19.</p>", "<p>In Britain's House of Commons last week, Ed Davey, an acting leader of another opposition party, the Liberal Democrats, confronted Johnson over the lack of health care funding.</p>", "<p>\"Does the prime minister not agree that the three Conservative governments since 2015 should have fixed the roof when the sun was shining?\" said Davey.</p>", "<p>Johnson responded that his administration has been addressing the problem: \"There are 8,700 more nurses this year than last year, and we are recruiting another 50,000 more,\" Johnson answered.</p>", "<p>Last week, the U.K.'s new Treasury chief, Rishi Sunak, vowed in his budget speech to provide the NHS  with whatever resources it needs to fight the coronavirus, including a portion of a $6 billion COVID-19 emergency fund.</p>", "<p>It's tough for many Britons to watch the NHS struggle because they love it so much. Anandaciva, of The King's Fund, says the service regularly tops public opinion polls on what makes people proud to be British.</p>", "<p>\"Something that is comprehensive, universal and free at the point of use, as a social construct,\" Anandaciva says, \"I think speaks to something in the British identity about a sense of fairness, our sense of everyone being in it together.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Thon splits his time between working here and on his own farm.</p>", "<p>He says there's good money in pepper \u2014 along with financial freedom not available to most day-wage earners.</p>", "<p>\"Owning a pepper farm is much better than being a construction worker,\" he says. \"We own our own land, we can stop and take a holiday, nobody can control us.

The murderous regime, which ruled from 1975-1979, \"didn't allow people to plant because they needed them to fight.\"</p>", "<p>When the fighting ended and the Khmer Rouge were defeated, some farmers, including Thon's relatives, returned to their lands and slowly nursed what vines remained back to health.</p>", "<p>It took time. Twenty years ago, only a few tons of pepper were grown annually. Last year, the 400-plus members of the <a href=\"http://www.kampotpepper.biz/\">Kampot Pepper Promotion Association</a> produced roughly 100 tons. The industry got a boost in 2016, when the European Union approved <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/food-safety-and-quality/certification/quality-labels/quality-schemes-explained_en#geographicalindications\">protected geographical indication</a> status for Kampot pepper, a prestigious designation affirming that its origin is crucial to its quality.</p>", "<p data-pym-loader data-child-src=\"https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/cambodia-locator-20200310/\" id=\"responsive-embed-cambodia-locator-20200310\"> Loading... </p>", "<p>\"It means like Champagne, it can grow only in a special area,\" Chaboche says. \"You can't compare Champagne with any other wine.

So is the harvesting, which happens at different stages as the pepper matures on the vine.</p>", "<p>The black, Chaboche says, crunching a peppercorn, is \"not too spicy, but then you have also the taste developing in the mouth, a little bit of citrus, mint.

So this one can be perfectly used with dessert, chocolate, fruit, on salads.\"</p>", "<p>Black pepper, she says, is a little more spicy than red, and better with meat. The red costs more than the black. But neither comes close to the white peppercorns, which can cost as much as $100 per ounce in Europe or the U.S.</p>", "<p>\"It's coming from the red, collected corn by corn, and we remove the skin, so it's really the essence and the kernel of the pepper,\" she says, crunching into a white peppercorn. \"The white one smells more like anise or herbs, and it's called by some Michelin chefs as the essence of pepper. Because it's really the inside of the pepper \u2014 and it's very tasty as well. It's used mainly for fish and seafood.\"</p>", "<p>All members of the Kampot pepper promotion association are committed to growing their crops organically. Most farmers don't own a lot of land, but do have knowledge passed down through generations.</p>", "<p>\"I am a fourth-generation pepper farmer,\" says Nguon Lay, president of the association. \"My father, his father, and his father before that.

That's why we want to buy their production at a fair price and find a market for them.\"</p>", "<p>The couple \u2014 who say they are in it for the long haul and have even acquired Cambodian citizenship \u2014 are looking to buy smaller farmers' production and market it as a second brand, and are aiding the pepper promotion association's effort to get fair trade certification for Kampot pepper, which would help the association's smaller members.</p>", "<p>Protecting Kampot pepper from counterfeiting, Porre says, is also a key to its future success. He and others warn that cheaper, inferior Vietnamese pepper may be marketed or mixed with the local product, and is diluting Kampot pepper's coveted brand. Vietnam, Cambodia's neighbor, is the world's largest producer of pepper, producing more than <a href=\"https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/522367/junes-pepper-exports-up-588-per-cent.html\">180,000 tons</a> last year alone.</p>", "<p>Consumers \"have to be very, very careful when you buy Kampot pepper [that] you know to check that this product is coming from a legal source,\" Porre says.</p>", "<p>Those who know the pepper best, of course, can tell right away if it's the real thing. \"All I have to do is taste it to know if it's real Kampot pepper or Vietnamese pepper,\" grower Hon Thon says.</p>", "<p>As for the quality of La Plantation's Kampot pepper versus his own farm's, \"I can say they are both the same,\" he says, laughing. \"I take care of both, so neither is more important. Good pepper is more important.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

They promised they would join him soon and bring his younger siblings.</p>", "<p>\"I remember my mother telling me to study hard,\" he says. \"I didn't understand where I was going.\"</p>", "<p>Nurzat stayed with relatives who ran a Uighur restaurant in downtown Cairo. At first, he says, he was so lonely that his stomach hurt every day. He called his parents on WeChat, the Chinese social media app, telling them he wanted to come home. After a few months, though, he learned Arabic well enough to make friends at school. The stomachaches went away. He started to relax.</p>", "<p>\"A couple of other Uighur kids even came to my school, and we became friends,\" he says.</p>", "<p>\n                Students watch a soccer game before the start of classes at Oku Uygur boarding school on the outskirts of Istanbul.

My uncle and two others escaped through the back door.\"</p>", "<p>By then, Nurzat was 7. For a few weeks, he and the adults hid out with an Egyptian friend.

He typically offers an \"elbow bump,\" nudging people gently with his arm. But Sandifer has to fight the deeply ingrained instinct to extend his hand.</p>", "<p>\"You know, people from the South are kind of touchy-feely. That's sort of our nature,\" he says. Plus, he's in real estate. \"We are a handshaking crowd.\"</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/30/801214939/the-surprising-origin-of-some-timely-advice-wash-your-hands\">Hand-washing</a> has become a global obsession, reminding Sandifer of his mother constantly telling him to sing the ABC's while doing so to ensure they were sufficiently cleansed.</p>", "<p>Virus and disease shaped Sandifer's childhood. In the 1960s, his father tended to polio patients in iron lungs, and his mother always wore gloves \u2014 for fashion, but also for hygiene.</p>", "<p>Now, everyone's preaching hand hygiene. And that's <a href=\"https://the1a.org/segments/contact-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-fewer-hugs-more-elbow-bumps/\">made the handshake taboo</a>. England's Premier League has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/coronavirus-hand-shake-premier-league-football-players-covid-19-a9380101.html\">banned them</a> during soccer matches.

He then apologized.</p>", "<p>So what replaces the handshake? That's up for grabs, so to speak. There's the fist bump. Or the elbow bump.

Asian cultures \u2014 which typically bow instead of handshake \u2014 also strike a humble and nice tone, he says.</p>", "<p>But the lack of consensus has made greeting people bewildering and, frankly, a bit awkward, and etiquette experts agree.</p>", "<p>Thomas Farley, a New York-based etiquette consultant, says he saw this in full effect over the weekend, when he attended several hands-free greetings, including a birthday party where the host posted a sign reading: \"This is a hug and kiss-free zone.\" </p>", "<p>That was a coronavirus first for Farley.</p>", "<p>\"What I liked about it, honestly, was it took some of the awkwardness out of it so that the ground rules were there so that everybody could not feel like the bad person,\" he says. </p>", "<p>At another party later that same day, people traded elbow bumps and foot shakes \u2014 known also as \"the Wuhan shake,\" after the virus's epicenter. That was weird, Farley says, because this was a house where shoes are left at the door. \"That made foot-to-foot contact a little bit perhaps more intimate than might be if you were actually wearing shoes,\" he says.</p>", "<p>The coronavirus culture is now forcing Farley to rethink how he teaches business etiquette. One core element had been the perfect handshake: Not flimsy \u2014 but not a death grip \u2014 and certainly not clammy.</p>", "<p>\"Now, of course, we're suddenly thrust into this new era,\" he says, although  even the new era has its limits for Farley.</p>", "<p>\"To elbow bump or chest bump. It's just ... it's not professional,\" he says in a tone tinged with disdain. </p>", "<p>His personal preference? \"As a Star Trek fan, I love the <a href=\"https://qz.com/352855/the-secret-history-behind-leonard-nimoys-spock-salute/\">'live long and prosper' greeting</a> with the split fingers.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Epidemiologists, How Did I Do?", "articleDate": "March 12, 2020", "contributors": null, "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"byline__name byline__name--block\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/469106148/malaka-gharib\" rel=\"author\" data-metrics='{\"action\":\"Click Byline\",\"category\":\"Story Metadata\"}'>\n      Malaka Gharib\n    </a>\n  </p>", "<p>Can I protect myself from catching the coronavirus? That's my question as cases mount in the United States.</p>", "<p>So I spent one day last week trying to be aware of doing all the right things. I mean, how hard can it be to wash your hands a lot and avoid crowds?</p>", "<p>I followed guidelines<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html\"> </a>from the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">World Health Organization</a>. Then I asked epidemiologists to grade me. Scroll to the end of the comic to find out how I did.</p>", "<p><strong>What the epidemiologists said</strong></p>", "<p>Melissa Nolan, a <a href=\"https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/public_health/faculty-staff/nolan_melissa.php\">professor of epidemiology</a> at the Arnold School of Public Health at the University of South Carolina, says my effort to document my hygiene habits during the outbreak was a worthy endeavor.</p>", "<p>\"This is a good exercise to make you notice your personal hygiene and have an appreciation for it,\" she says. \"It can make you see how important it is to prevent exposure, especially around populations vulnerable to coronavirus,\" including elderly people and those who are sick.</p>", "<p>After I recounted my day to Nolan, she gave me an \"A for effort, but a B- overall.\"</p>", "<p>\"The most egregious things you did was being in close quarters with people,\" says Nolan \u2014 like eating at the salad bar, going to the movie theater and getting in a taxi or a ride share.</p>", "<p><strong>Lessons Learned From My Day</strong></p>", "<p>\"Be conscious of the potential ways you could get exposed and where there's a high potential for transmission of the disease,\" she says. At the salad bar, for example, even though workers may be wearing gloves, eventually the workers will use those gloved hands, out of habit, to touch their faces. And while salad bars have splash guards on the side of the customer, there usually isn't one on the side of the worker interacting with the food. Current evidence shows that the coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html\">can live on surfaces</a> for hours to days. And it doesn't help that what are served at salad bars are <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/food-safety\">moist, raw foods</a> where pathogens in general thrive, she says.</p>", "<p>At the movies, Nolan said that no, breathing into my shirt would not have helped me prevent infection if the woman who sneezed behind me had the coronavirus: \"If she had high amounts of virus coming out of that sneeze \u2014 via aerosolized particles from your lungs being breathed out \u2014 you would have to be fitted with an N95 respirator to protect yourself.\"<strong> </strong></p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/dt14\">Dr. Deliang Tang</a>, a molecular epidemiologist at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, gave me an A-. Like Nolan, he says that going to the movies was probably not a good idea (although to be fair, lots of other people were unafraid \u2014 the theater was packed). \"We are generally recommending the public to not go to any gathering places at this moment,\" he says. \"It would have been better if you just stayed home.\"</p>", "<p>CDC guidelines state that you can get COVID-19 from \"<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html\">close contact</a>\" with someone infected with the virus. That means being within 6 feet of an infected individual for a prolonged period of time. Being in an enclosed space with the  driver of a ride share, for example, is considered \"close contact,\" says Nolan.</p>", "<p>Nolan says I should have just walked. (Although the 50-minute trek from the office to the salad place would have been one long walk!)</p>", "<p>Tang says I did a good job of assuming that every surface I touched at the coffee shop, at the office and in public was contaminated. \"In lab practice, we consider every single biological sample as contagious \u2014 it's to help protect lab personnel,\" he explains. \"So you considering every surface as dirty as a precautionary measure and washing your hands all the time \u2014 it's good discipline.\"</p>", "<p>And when I paused during the day to wipe down high-touch surfaces <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html\">as the CDC recommends</a> \u2014 objects such as your phone, your desk and the keyboard that you and others you work with touch every day \u2014 that was a smart move to get rid of pathogens, he says.</p>", "<p>The epidemiologists shared some advice that will help me in the weeks ahead. I asked Nolan about opening doors \u2014 especially handles that you have to pull. How do you do that without contaminating your hands? Is there a better part of the handle to pull from? She says to use a paper towel.</p>", "<p>She says that using an object like a pen to dial a phone or scratch my face was a good idea \u2014 unless I then put that pen in my mouth (an unfortunate habit for many anxious souls).</p>", "<p>I asked Nolan what to do if you don't have hand sanitizer \u2014 which was sold out at stores I visited. Her alternative was simple: Just wash your hands with soap and water.</p>", "<p>How about using my knuckles to touch things? Was that better than using my fingers? \"Hypothetically, your hands \u2014 the palm side \u2014 are more moist [because of sweat],\" says Nolan. \"It's possible for viral particles to stay alive longer there. And you don't technically use your knuckles, which are drier, to touch your face.\"<strong> </strong></p>", "<p><a href=\"https://publichealth.yale.edu/people/peter_krause.profile\">Peter Krause</a>, a senior research scientist in epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, gave me an A+ for \"making me laugh,\" he says. \"How you touched the handle [from the bottom], how you ate the muffin [without hands] \u2014 the general concepts are right.\"</p>", "<p>\"I have to say,\" he adds, \"you're describing exactly what I do.\"</p>", "<p><em>Malaka Gharib is an NPR editor and the author and illustrator of </em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/575400/i-was-their-american-dream-by-malaka-gharib/\">I Was Their American Dream: A Graphic Memoir</a>, <em>about being first-generation Filipino Egyptian American.</em></p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Americans will be quarantined upon arrival, he said.</p>", "<p>\"You have to have separation, or this thing takes longer to go away,\" he said.</p>", "<p>According to Wolf's statement, U.S. passengers who have been in the affected European nations will be required to travel through \"select airports where the U.S. has implemented enhanced screening procedures.\" Vice President Pence said Thursday there are 13 such airports and added that those travelers who return to the U.S. from the EU will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.</p>", "<p>Pence did not list the airports, but Wolf, in his statement late Wednesday, said DHS will list them in the next 48 hours. </p>", "<p>The administration previously banned travel from China, and during that time travelers from China were <a href=\"http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/Government-Imposed-Travel-Restrictions-OPS-DIS-03/default.aspx\">flown to airports </a>in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Detroit, Newark, N.J., Honolulu, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.</p>", "<p><strong>I am from one of these countries but have a green card.

You can </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money\">sign up here</a>. </p>", "<p>It's been a crazy couple of days, and we showed up at the office Monday morning with as many questions as anyone. And we've been reading as fast as we can to try and figure out how to understand a spreading pandemic, a spiraling oil market, warnings of a coming recession, and the largest drop in the S&amp;P 500 since the 2008 financial crisis. So here's a few of the best answers we found from around the econ universe. </p>", "<p><strong>What Does the Coronavirus Mean for the Global Economy?</strong></p>", "<p>We've been talking a lot in the office about supply and demand shocks, which is econospeak for forces that knock economies off their trajectories. And we're starting to see them firsthand. A trendy noodle shop opened up across the street last summer. We haven't been able to get in because of the lines. On Friday, the city was pretty empty, and so was the noodle shop: That's a classic demand shock. We took advantage and got our noodles in five minutes. Monday we returned for more of the same. There weren't that many customers, but it took 30 minutes to get our noodles. Why? Half the kitchen staff stayed home. \"People are paranoid,\" said the guy at the register. When an economy can't make goods because of a labor shortage, that's a supply shock. The noodle shop is getting shocked both ways, and so, maybe, is the economy. </p>", "<p>The most authoritative discussion we found of this is <a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=62385196efb9fb163d6002dc107b1b2278ab23c7b8f4735b06960914f6d1d33710a4df1c7429c812c1db33d99cbcf0b3b335dd3abb21f331\">a new piece</a> from Gita Gopinath, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. She lists potential economic policies for governments to help deal with these shocks right now.  </p>", "<p><strong>How Bad Is the Coronavirus?</strong> </p>", "<p>One of the most helpful things that came across our feed recently is Justin Fox's piece for <em>Bloomberg View</em>, \"<a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=62385196efb9fb168ff9f1e8dae955024fbda895456043b9a68cfa0f896d128a992fc40d0e18d49e7356374059d664d6b4eab31213aa83e1\">How Bad is the Coronavirus? Let's Run the Numbers</a>.\" As he puts it, \"The coronavirus outbreak has been turning a lot of us into amateur epidemiologists.\" Though it's an opinion piece, it doesn't have a take. It just has numbers. </p>", "<p>And as budding amateur epidemiologists ourselves, we read carefully about the medical term \"R,\" which denotes the infection rate. Fox writes, \"Could Covid-19 really spread as widely as the flu? If allowed to, sure. The standard metric for infectiousness is what's called the reproduction number, or R0. It is usually pronounced 'R naught,' and the zero after the R should be rendered in subscript, but it's a simple enough concept. An R0 of one means each person with the disease can be expected to infect one more person. If the number dips below one, the disease will peter out. If it gets much above one, the disease can spread rapidly.\" Right now, Fox says, the R0 of the COVID-19 coronavirus is 2.8, meaning it is on average spreading from one person to 2.8 people. But it is below one in communities like Wuhan, China, where it started. We think we're going to be hearing more about \"R-naught,\" and we're hoping it goes below one.  </p>", "<p><strong>How Should We Think About the Market?</strong></p>", "<p>We don't do buys and sells and pops and drops and all that market-watching, but sometimes you can't look away. These last couple of days have been those kinds of days. Things got so disheveled today we actually turned on the television. But we learned more from the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>'s Andy Kessler, who was an investor before he was a writer, and he does a nice job <a href=\"http://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=62385196efb9fb16ee5af6b1ff105d85e7a89dbd8e52be307c88db4ce3412161e26f6f4316a66da4e8ede8ed7fb2d3259efe621e5b1f9586\">explaining</a> how he (and the market) thinks about and prices risk. He argues that the risk is essentially a timeline projected into the future, and the pricing of the market reflects how long we think things are going to be uncertain.

As Russia is also undergoing upheaval and difficulty, \"stability may be more important and must be given priority,\" he said, especially \"when a country still has many problems.\"</p>", "<p>Russia watchers, who have long assumed Putin would seek to retain power after his current term expires in 2024, were not surprised.</p>", "<p>\"The Russian system has been existing under this perpetual question mark of 'what is Putin going to do?' \" Fiona Hill, President Trump's former top Russia adviser, told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly.</p>", "<p>Many observers thought Putin might take on a different role that would let him maintain influence \u2013 like Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or Kazakhstan's first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who now chairs the country's security council and holds the title \"leader of the nation.\" <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/796583763/russias-government-resigns-as-putin-moves-to-change-the-constitution\">There was talk</a> of having Putin lead the country's State Council, which would be strengthened, with the presidency becoming more of a symbolic position.</p>", "<p>Ultimately, the Kremlin decided to simply change the presidential term limits so that Putin could maintain control, Loyola University Chicago professor Michael Khodarkovsky told NPR.</p>", "<p>\"The Kremlin is searching for ways to keep Putin in power,\" Khodarkovsky said. \"Putin and his inner circle seem to have decided that the way to do it is to eliminate term limits and allow Putin to run again. It would be inconceivable for Putin to lose.\"</p>", "<p>The 67-year-old Putin has ruled Russia for more than 20 years, serving as both president and prime minister. His current presidential term is set to expire in 2024; should he run again, Putin would be 83 when the next term limit runs out in 2036. \"My own feeling,\" said Khodarkovsky, \"is that Putin wants to beat Stalin, who ruled for almost 30 years.\"</p>", "<p>\"Putin will stay in power and in his present position for life,\" said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. \"As for the future of Russian democracy, we will need to wait till after Putin passes from the stage.\"</p>", "<p>\"Putin has become the wild card in his own system,\" Hill said. \"If he goes, it seems destabilizing.

Here's a look at some of the measures that the nine countries with the most cases have implemented so far.</p>", "<p><strong>China </strong></p>", "<p>China has had more than 80,000 cases and more than 3,100 deaths since the coronavirus emerged in the city of Wuhan in December. People in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei province have been largely confined to their homes for almost 50 days \u2014 a policy that is controlling the movements of tens of millions of people.</p>", "<p>One Wuhan resident recently <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/03/809965742/personal-essay-from-wuhan-living-in-hell\">wrote</a> that life in the city since Jan. 23 has \"become a living hell.\" </p>", "<p>The author, who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisals for speaking critically of the Chinese government, described an atmosphere of chaos and desperation: \"Perhaps it is true that only China can build a hospital in 10 days, only China can mobilize so many people to devote themselves to the anti-epidemic agenda, only China can lock down a city with millions of people at lightning speed.\"</p>", "<p>The lockdown began in Wuhan on Jan. 23. It happened suddenly, just before the Lunar New Year holiday, giving residents scant time to make preparations. </p>", "<p>Within weeks, policies became stricter. As NPR's Emily Feng <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/21/806958341/restrictions-and-rewards-how-china-is-locking-down-half-a-billion-citizens\">reported</a>: The provincial government in Hubei began enforcing round-the-clock \"closed management\" of all residential complexes, banning the private use of cars, forbidding residents from leaving their apartments without permission and requiring purchasers of cold medicine to disclose their temperature, address and identification number at the pharmacy. Many community officials began buying and delivering groceries and medication for residents in their jurisdiction. </p>", "<p>\"Citizens are also financially rewarded for reporting those who fail to follow quarantine orders,\" Feng noted. \"These methods reflect a decades-long history of social control now being mobilized on an unprecedented scale.\"</p>", "<p>Many residents in Wuhan have become <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/08/812925775/photos-in-a-coronavirus-crisis-delivery-workers-can-be-a-lifeline\">reliant on delivery workers</a> on scooters and motorcycles to deliver food or other necessities. Hospitals also rely on those couriers to deliver medical supplies, in which case the drivers wear hazmat suits. </p>", "<p>The severe restrictions in Hubei are being credited for a decline in new cases there. But such measures might be difficult to enforce in democratic societies.</p>", "<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the Trump administration's <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-presidents-coronavirus-task-force/\">coronavirus task force</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-march-8-2020-n1152446\">told</a> NBC's <em>Meet The Press </em>on Sunday that China's measures kept the outbreak from getting even worse.</p>", "<p>\"Their efforts have been draconian, something we never would be able to do here,\" Fauci said. \"But even though there's a lot of things that have unintended negative consequences of that ... I think they prevented a broader spread.\"</p>", "<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping toured Wuhan on Tuesday \u2014 the third day that no new cases had been reported outside the epicenter of Hubei. During the visit, Xi said the country's outbreak has been \"basically curbed.\"</p>", "<p>Officials haven't said, however, when the restrictions in Hubei will be lifted.</p>", "<p><strong>Italy</strong></p>", "<p>Italy has more than 9,000 cases and 463 deaths related to the virus, mostly in the north. The number of cases there has jumped significantly in recent days.</p>", "<p>On Monday, the Italian government announced extraordinary measures to contain the virus that first spread there in late February. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared all of Italy a \"red zone\" \u2014 meaning people should stay home except for work and other emergencies.</p>", "<p>Public gatherings have been banned and freedom of movement sharply curtailed. All domestic sporting events in the country have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/all-sport-italy-suspended-until-3-april-coronavirus-serie-a\">suspended</a> until April 3 \u2014 a big deal in soccer-mad Italy. </p>", "<p>\n                Police officers and soldiers check passengers leaving the main train station in Milan, Italy.

The government declared on Monday that the whole country is a \"red zone.\"</p>", "<p>\"Conte told Italians they must change their habits starting now\" and cited the rising number of cases and deaths, NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports from Rome.  \"Under the slogan 'I'm staying home,' the prime minister told Italians the health of our citizens is in danger, we have to impose sacrifices. He also said the virus outbreak is straining the health care system.\"</p>", "<p>The primary goal is to keep people from gathering in groups. All museums, cinemas and theaters have been closed until April 3. Schools and universities are closed. Bars and restaurants must close by 6 p.m. each day, and malls and supermarkets are closed on weekends. Moving from one town to another requires signing a police form self-certifying that a person is traveling for work, health or emergency purposes.</p>", "<p>Those stringent measures had already been implemented over the weekend in northern Italy, where most of the country's confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 are located. </p>", "<p>Italian journalist Beppe Severgnini <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/813577453/a-quarter-of-italys-population-is-in-quarantine-because-of-coronavirus\">told NPR</a> on Monday that most Italians seemed to respect the restrictions. \"Italy, in a way, is more cohesive than many people think. Italians are behaving responsibly,\" he said. \"This this thing has to be stopped. The only way to stop it is to take drastic measures while we can.\"</p>", "<p>Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said Tuesday that payments on mortgages will be suspended nationally due to the outbreak.</p>", "<p><strong>Iran</strong></p>", "<p>Iran has reported more than 8,000 cases and nearly 300 deaths from COVID-19.</p>", "<p>Public gatherings, including Friday prayers in Tehran and other major cities, have been canceled.

The country has <a href=\"http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/policies/view?articleId=183095\">50 drive-through screening clinics</a> where people can get a medical exam and have a sample taken in just 10 minutes.

Kindergartens and elementary schools are required to operate \"emergency child care\" for those whose parents are working. </p>", "<p><strong>Spain</strong></p>", "<p>Spain has reported more than 1,600 cases and 35 deaths related to coronavirus.</p>", "<p>Authorities in regions with the most cases \u2014 Madrid, Basque Country and La Rioja \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.es/20200309/madrid-closes-schools-as-coronavirus-continues-spread-across-spain\">have ordered</a> the closure of all schools, universities and daycare centers for two weeks. Flights between Spain and Italy have been suspended and large gatherings canceled in the three regions. Soccer matches for Spain's La Liga will be played before empty stadiums for the next two weeks.</p>", "<p>Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa encouraged companies to reduce working hours and travel and to support remote work.</p>", "<p>\"I know these are measures that are disliked and that disrupt the normal life of many citizens, but we are adopting the measures because they are necessary,\" Illa said at a news conference, according to The Associated Press, explaining that the actions were based on \"scientific evidence and on the criteria of experts.\" </p>", "<p>Outside the outbreak areas, major events are slated to continue. <a href=\"https://www.visitvalencia.com/en/events-valencia/festivities/the-fallas\">Las Fallas</a>, a huge festival in Valencia that attracts enormous crowds, is taking place is currently taking place as scheduled.</p>", "<p><strong>France</strong></p>", "<p>France has had more than 1,400 cases and at least 30 deaths.</p>", "<p>The country announced a nationwide ban on gatherings of more than 1,000 people, with exemptions for things like public transit.

Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-medical-mystery-can-classrooms-spread-coronavirus-11583451947\">said last week</a> that France doesn't want to take a blanket approach to closing schools. </p>", "<p>\"We don't think it's the appropriate strategy in France's case,\" Blanquer said. \"If you're a nurse with children and you have to stay at home to watch your children who aren't in school, well then you're not at the hospital helping those who need it.\" </p>", "<p>France has <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200303-coronavirus-france-to-requisition-face-masks-for-use-by-health-professionals-those-infected\">requisitioned </a>all of the country's surgical masks for distribution to those who need them.

Cases have been found in 37 states and the District of Columbia.</p>", "<p>The federal government has not announced significant nationwide measures to contain the spread of the virus, beyond restricting travelers from certain countries from entering the U.S. Restrictions or containment measures have mostly come from state and local authorities.</p>", "<p>On Tuesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1237411054453284870\">announced</a> a \"containment area\" with a one-mile radius in New Rochelle, in suburban Westchester County. The National Guard has been deployed to the containment area to deliver food to homes and help with cleaning of public spaces. All schools, churches, community centers within that radius will be closed and large gatherings banned, measures that are set to last for two weeks starting Thursday. </p>", "<p>California's Santa Clara County has banned all gatherings of more than 1,000 people, NPR's Eric Westervelt reports. County officials warn that violators could face a shutdown by police, as well as possible fines or arrest. The policy will upend conferences and concerts; the NHL's San Jose Sharks may play behind closed doors. </p>", "<p>\"These are trying days and the weeks ahead are going to be difficult for everyone in our community,\" said San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo. \"And I'm confident that if we take care of each other and work together, we are collectively stronger than this virus.\"</p>", "<p>Some schools have been closed in areas where cases have been identified or there is concern of exposure.

Zaman (@mhzaman) is a professor of biomedical engineering and international health at Boston University, and the author of </em>Biography of Resistance: The Epic Battle Between People and Pathogens<em>, to be published by Harper Wave in April.<br></em></p>", "<p>The message about coronavirus<strong> </strong>to the public is loud and clear: If you feel sick, call your doctor. There is nothing wrong with the message. But not everyone has the luxury of calling a doctor.</p>", "<p>In some of the places I have worked in the last few years \u2014 particularly in understanding barriers to healthcare in refugee camps in Pakistan, Uganda and Lebanon \u2014 the ability to call a doctor does not exist. When I recently contacted a friend who helps provide primary care to refugees at the Syrian-Lebanese border to ask about pandemic-related anxiety in the camp, he asked me a question in response: How do you wash your hands several times a day when there is no access to clean water in your entire camp?</p>", "<p>The challenge of COVID-19 is testing countries, governments and their citizens in new and unprecedented ways. Schools have been closed from Italy to Japan, Iran to Ireland, and more recently in the U.S. Universities including Boston University, where I teach, are moving all classes to an online format. Federal and state governments are recommending a ban on large gatherings. Conferences are being postponed, and sports events are canceling at unprecedented rates to decrease the likelihood of disease spread.</p>", "<p>But what happens if your home is in a confined refugee settlement?</p>", "<p>The impact of armed conflict on health systems and infrastructure is well known. Hospitals are destroyed, medical personnel are either killed or forced to flee, supply chains for medical equipment and medicines are disrupted. This is in addition to increased injuries and trauma, as well as greater exposure to infectious agents and unhygienic environments.</p>", "<p>People who are forced due to armed conflict or other reasons to flee their homes can end up living in cramped environments with little access to medical care. Infections and superbugs thrive in such environments, and patients typically can't obtain appropriate and quality antibiotics.</p>", "<p>While there are no known cases yet of COVID-19 in refugee camps \u2014 which is likely due to a lack of testing \u2014 the disease is going to hit these communities hard.</p>", "<p>Despite global attention to the challenges posed by the coronavirus and increasing calls to support low- and middle-income countries, refugees are largely ignored and left to their own devices. A global approach is needed to avoid more tragic loss of life.</p>", "<p>The global health security agenda too often focuses on the security of the rich and the powerful \u2014 not those who have no political agency. Because refugees are not citizens of countries that host them, little has been discussed about how nearly <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/refugees/\">30 million people</a> should prepare for this outbreak \u2014 or the next. It is not even clear what, if any, resources are available to refugees to seek proper information, let alone proper care.</p>", "<p>Beyond the obvious ethical and humanitarian dimensions in providing information and care for<strong> </strong>those who have been forcibly displaced from their homes, there is another obvious reason to support refugees in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>", "<p>Refugee settlements tend to have a high population density, and are often close-knit communities. As a result, any outbreak can spread quickly. With an increase in the number of refugees who seek work <a href=\"https://www.rescue-uk.org/sites/default/files/document/986/201112urbanrefsforechoadvocacyevent0.pdf\">in urban areas</a> and routinely travel back and forth between camps and cities, the problem could quickly escalate.</p>", "<p>Underlying health issues stemming from poor nutrition or lack of vaccination can make refugees even more vulnerable. Secondary infections, including those from drug-resistant pathogens, are also common in these environments. An outbreak would also increase the likelihood of infection among staff at clinics, schools and humanitarian agencies who work in refugee settlements. The workers and staff could in turn infect others in their own communities.</p>", "<p>The obvious and sustainable solution is to improve the health system in these camps so refugees can receive equitable care. Given the urgency of the situation, this is unlikely to happen overnight.</p>", "<p>What can happen \u2014 and will mitigate the risk \u2014 is a three-pronged approach.</p>", "<p>First, there must be a recognition that refugees are highly vulnerable to this outbreak. International public health agencies, in partnership with local health authorities, must ensure that accurate information and practical advice is provided to these communities in a clear, easy to understand and transparent manner. This would require efforts by countries and international agencies in bringing together experts in infectious diseases and refugee health to come up with a clear plan to tackle a possible (and likely) outbreak.</p>", "<p>Second, national and international funding that is being mobilized to fight the coronavirus should include resources for refugees and forcibly displaced communities. This can come in several forms, including the creation of new, temporary health facilities near refugee camps, setting up screening centers and mobilizing additional health workers. Refugees are unlikely to have disposable income and many would therefore not be able to travel or pay for out-of-pocket expenses for testing.</p>", "<p>Refugees also can face high levels of discrimination and xenophobia in some host countries \u2014 another reason why testing and care should be given close to the camps. It should not require extensive travel to areas where refugees are reluctant to go, due to fear of physical and emotional harm.</p>", "<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the United Nations, World Health Organization, regional agencies and local health authorities must build trust with refugee communities at this time. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5721651/\">Research shows</a> that trust plays a central role in how refugees (and other vulnerable groups) seek health care. To create trust, refugees need access to information and to knowledgeable care providers who speak their language and have a strong sense of empathy.</p>", "<p>Top-down, heavy-handed approaches that involve heavily armed police or security agencies with a history of using disproportionate force are unlikely to work. Instead, partnerships that include refugee community leaders and community representatives are going to be far more effective in managing the crisis.</p>", "<p>We are in uncharted territory, and it remains to be seen how the virus is going to spread. However, it is clear that taking care of vulnerable and marginalized groups will not only help manage the COVID-19 crisis better by reducing the degree of global spread and protecting those at risk; it may also pave the way for improving the health and well-being of refugees well beyond this crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

But does the temperature of the water matter? What's the right way to dry your hands? Why is washing your hands better than using hand sanitizer?</p>", "<p>We talked to hand-washing researchers and specialists to learn more about the most effective steps.</p>", "<p><strong>Prep </strong></p>", "<p>If possible, you should remove jewelry like rings, bracelets and watches first so you can scrub your hands without anything getting in the way. But \"that's not always realistic,\" says <a href=\"https://deohs.washington.edu/faculty/tania-m-busch-isaksen\">Tania Busch Isaksen</a>, a lecturer at the University of Washington's department of environmental and occupational health sciences. If you're leaving the jewelry on, just try your best to wash around and under it as much as the jewelry allows.</p>", "<p><strong>Wet Your Hands </strong></p>", "<p>Start by wetting your hands with cold, lukewarm or warm water. These temperatures are all fine in facilitating the removal of pathogens from your hands. \"The idea is just that you don't want to use really hot water,\" says <a href=\"https://ghss.georgetown.edu/people/sorrell/\">Erin Sorrell</a>, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Georgetown. If your hands dry out from using hot water, that could lead to cracks in your skin that expose you to infections, she says.</p>", "<p>You wet your hands before adding soap so that the water can help the soap dissolve and do its job of removing dirt and germs, Sorrell adds.</p>", "<p>You won't need running water again till you rinse, so you can turn off the tap (which will save water).</p>", "<p><strong>Lather Up</strong></p>", "<p>Soap is critical to killing germs on your hands. SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is wrapped in a membrane that can be broken up by the lather from soap, says Dr. <a href=\"https://physicians.lahey.org/details/1664/mark-gendreau-emergency_medicine-peabody\">Mark Gendreau</a>, the chief medical officer at Beverly Hospital in Massachusetts. That renders the virus particles unable to infect you.</p>", "<p>You don't have to be picky about which kind of soap you use. Antibacterial or regular soap \u2014 in liquid or bar form \u2014 will work. But \"you want to use enough soap that you're going to get a good lather,\" Gendreau adds.</p>", "<p>It's most important to maintain the lather as you're scrubbing, Busch Isaksen says. You can always add a little more soap if needed to make sure you see a healthy crop of bubbles on your hands throughout the 20 seconds. This is a good sign that you have enough lather to break up virus particles.</p>", "<p><strong>Timing </strong></p>", "<p>The common guideline is 20 seconds, but you're actually going to need a bit more time than that. \"The 20 seconds start when you have the soap in your hands, in the lathering process,\" Sorrell says.</p>", "<p><strong>Scrub</strong></p>", "<p>Microbes, including viruses, can take up residence all over your hands, so you want to make sure you're hitting all the areas. Fingertips, thumbs and spots between your fingers are commonly missed, Sorrell says.</p>", "<p>One step in the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gpsc/clean_hands_protection/en/\">World Health Organization's guide</a> suggests rubbing your fingers against the opposite palm \u2014 a move designed to clean your fingertips and get some soap under the tips of your nails, Gendreau adds.</p>", "<p>\"Depending on the length of your nails, it can be more difficult to really get under there,\" Sorrell says. She recommends rubbing the edges of your nails against your palms.</p>", "<p><strong>Rinse</strong></p>", "<p>Rinse the soap away \u2014 along with the pathogens.</p>", "<p><strong>Turn off the water</strong></p>", "<p>It's a snap when using touchless faucets. But not every restroom or home bathroom is so equipped. WHO guidelines suggest using a paper towel to turn off the faucet lest you pick up pathogens from the faucet itself. But there isn't clear research showing this actually keeps you healthier in the long run, according to the CDC.</p>", "<p>Nonetheless, Gendreau, Sorrell and Busch Isaksen all advise that you don't directly touch the faucet. Faucets are \"worry spots in terms of areas that could be contaminated in restrooms,\" Gendreau says.</p>", "<p>You shouldn't touch the faucet handle with your clean hands, Busch Isaksen adds. \"You just turned that on when they were dirty, so now you're recontaminating your hand.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Dry</strong></p>", "<p>Wet hands can pick up germs more easily than dry hands, the CDC says. Without drying, \"you're more prone to contaminating yourself\" when your newly washed hands encounter germs from other sources, Gendreau adds.</p>", "<p>But it's not totally clear which way of drying your hands is best \u2014 if you should use paper towels, a cloth towel or air blowers, Busch Isaksen says. \"This is a point of controversy.\"</p>", "<p>Paper towels are a good option, according to Busch Isaksen, Gendreau and Sorrel. There's not enough evidence to say whether air blowers are any better or worse, according to <a href=\"https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=8691\">Dr. Vincent Hill</a>, chief of the CDC's Waterborne Disease Prevention Branch.</p>", "<p>Sorrell recommends \"only touching the towels that you will be using yourself.\" Or if you're at home, a cloth towel works as long as you wash those towels in a washing machine with detergent every couple of days.</p>", "<p>Sharing a towel with other people in your household isn't ideal, Busch Isaksen says. And if someone you live with is sick, that individual definitely should get a personal-use towel.</p>", "<p><strong>Door dilemma</strong></p>", "<p>Once the faucet is shut off and your hands are dry, you might encounter another potential source of infection \u2014 the door handle of the bathroom. It's a good precaution to use another part of your body, or a paper towel, to open the door when you're leaving the bathroom, Sorrell says. More germs could lurk on the door handle.</p>", "<p><strong>What about hand sanitizer?</strong></p>", "<p>If you don't have access to soap and running water, hand sanitizer is a good backup, Busch Isaksen says. Just make sure it's at least 60% alcohol, since sanitizers with less alcohol than that might not kill as many germs. \"With hand sanitizer, you're applying that. Dirt and grime can remain on your hand and sometimes can hide the bacteria and virus particles,\" she warns. Any debris on your hands might have these germs within it, and hand sanitizer won't necessarily get to them. \"Hand washing is far superior.\"</p>", "<p><em>Editor's note: This story has been revised to include more complete information on hand-washing procedures. </em></p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

But the once-powerful cartel can no longer move markets alone. It needs the support of Russia, which is not an OPEC member but has recently been coordinating with the organization.</p>", "<p>Yet Russia has resisted calls for production cuts.

The women returned to the seminary only this February, and have dared security forces to remove them again. </p>", "<p>On Sunday, dozens of the seminary women turned up at the counter-rally, clad in long black robes, headscarves and face veils, segregated from dozens of men who stood in a nearby park. They stood in military-style rows, their fearsome appearance only jarred by blue, green and pink bows pinned to their shoulders, to identify which bus they should return on, explained one 25-year-old, who only gave her first name, Rubina. </p>", "<p>\"We don't want women to make choices for their bodies.

Some waved the red flag of a leftist party. Others held up signs, including \"my body, my choice,\" but they denounced so-called \"honor\" killings, where men murder their female relatives for bringing alleged shame onto the family. Some demanded to know the fate of female political activists who mysteriously disappeared. </p>", "<p>\"Pakistan is getting more and more divided over time,\" said Ambreen Gilani, a 41-year-old development consultant, gesturing to the Islamists across the road. The opposition to the women's march helped motivate another protester to turn up, Sukaina Kazmi, a chemical engineer. She gestured to her Muslim headscarf, \"Our religion does not teach us any of the things they are standing up against, our religion actually does fight for women's rights,\" she said. </p>", "<p>As the protesters regrouped and walked away from the dozens of men trying to assault them, one organizer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnamRathor\">Anam Rathor</a>, said the violence underscored why they were demonstrating. \"This proves our point, and this movement is growing.

{"title": "When Xenophobia Spreads Like A Virus", "articleDate": "March 4, 2020", "contributors": null, "articleBodyText": ["<p class=\"byline__name byline__name--block\">\n    \n      Natalie Escobar\n    \n  </p>", "<p>The global response to COVID-19 has made clear that the fear of contracting disease has an ugly cousin: xenophobia. As the coronavirus has spread from China to other countries, anti-Asian discrimination has followed closely behind, manifesting in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/11/804750392/coronavirus-affects-bottom-line-for-businesses-in-u-s-chinatowns\">plummeting sales at Chinese restaurants</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/26/809741251/san-francisco-chinatown-affected-by-coronavirus-fears-despite-no-confirmed-cases\">near-deserted Chinatown districts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/20/us/coronavirus-racist-attacks-against-asian-americans/index.html\">racist bullying</a> against people perceived to be Chinese.  </p>", "<p>We asked our listeners whether they had experienced this kind of coronavirus-related racism and xenophobia firsthand. And judging by the volume of emails, comments and tweets we got in response, the harassment has been intense for Asian Americans across the country \u2014 regardless of ethnicity, location or age.</p>", "<p>A common theme across our responses: Public transit has been <em>really</em> hostile. Roger Chiang, who works in San Francisco, recalled a white woman glaring at him on the train to work, covering her nose and mouth. When he told her in a joking tone that he didn't have the coronavirus, she replied that she \"wasn't racist \u2014 she just didn't want to get sick.\"</p>", "<p>Allison Park from Brooklyn told us that when visiting D.C., she saw a man making faces at her on the Metro train. She tried to move away from him, but he wouldn't stop. After a while, she said, he confronted her outright, saying: \"Get out of here. Go back to China. I don't want none of your swine flu here.\" A week later, on a Muni train in San Francisco, another man yelled the same thing to her \u2014 \"Go back to China\" \u2014 and even threatened to shoot her. </p>", "<p>Even a single cough or sneeze can trigger harassment. Amy Jiravisitcul from Boston said a man on a bus muttered about \"diseased Chinese people\" when she sneezed into her sleeve. When she confronted him, he told her: \"Cover your fucking mouth.\" When South San Franciscan Diane Tran sneezed into her elbow in a hallway in a hospital, where she was getting a flu shot, she said a middle-aged white woman yelled a racist slur at her.</p>", "<p>Children have been targeted, too \u2014 by other children and adults alike. Devin Cabanilla, from Seattle, told us that a Costco food sample vendor told his Korean wife and mixed-race son to \"get away\" from the samples, questioning whether they had come from China. <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-kid-turned-away-food-samples-at-costco-2020-1\">Company executives later apologized</a> to his family, but he's still shaken. \"It just reminds me that when people look at us, they don't see us as American,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Thirteen-year-old Sara Aalgaard told us that since the outbreak, many middle-school classmates of hers have been targeting the small population of Asian Americans at her school in Middletown, Conn. \"People call us 'corona,' \" she said, or ask if they eat dogs. Rebecca Wen from North Brunswick, N.J., told us that her 9-year-old son reported that his 11-year-old classmate said: \"You're Chinese, so you must have the coronavirus.\"</p>", "<p>The anti-Asian harassment isn't limited to the U.S., either. International outlets have reported harassment in majority-white countries like Australia, where parents in Melbourne<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/sensationalist-media-is-exacerbating-racist-coronavirus-fears-we-need-to-combat-it\"> refused to let Asian doctors treat their children</a>, and Canada, where around 10,000 Toronto-area people signed a petition <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/chinese-canadians-denounce-rising-xenophobia-tied-coronavirus-200202191216923.html\">calling for the local school district to track and isolate Chinese-Canadian students</a> who may have traveled to China for the Lunar New Year.</p>", "<p>In Germany, Thea Suh said that when she sat down on her train to work, the person sitting next to turned away from her and covered his face. A few days later, a woman told her to move her \"corona-riddled body\" elsewhere. Not once did someone step in to help, she said. \"I have also not seen or heard any German politician or major influencer coming to our defenses,\" she said. \"And I feel like as a part of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks\">model minority</a>, we are being left alone.\"</p>", "<p>That's another common theme from the responses we got: Witnesses and bystanders were slow to intervene. Allison Park remembers that when the man on the D.C. Metro told her to go back to China, the train was nearly two-thirds full, but no one said anything. At best, she got some sympathetic looks. Amy Jiravisitcul said that the other passengers ignored the yelling, which made her wonder whether they thought she was just making a scene.</p>", "<p>And when the harassment has passed, unease still lingers. Jane Hong from New York told us that when she and a fellow Korean American were walking from lunch, she heard a man screaming \"yuck\" in their direction. Now, she notices whenever people on the street look at her for more than a passing glance.</p>", "<p>\"I don't know if 'paranoid' is the word,\" Hong said. \"Now it's in my head. I wonder if they are thinking, 'I have to stay away from her, I don't want to walk near her.' Now that the seed has been planted in my head, it's hard to not have that thought cross my mind.\"</p>", "<p><em>For more on xenophobia and coronavirus, </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch\">listen to this week's episode of the Code Switch podcast</a><em>.

And a prisoner exchange that was to take place before those intra-Afghan talks start is being rejected by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. </p>", "<p>On Friday in western Kabul, the Associated Press reports that gunmen opened fire at a largely Shiite gathering, killing at least 32 and injuring scores more.  The Islamic State-Khorasan Province claimed <a href=\"http://thefortress.com.pk/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-kabul-attack-that-killed-27/\">responsibility</a> for the attack.</p>", "<p>All this comes after the U.S. and the Taliban \u2014 but not the Afghan government \u2014 signed an agreement Feb. 29 in Doha, Qatar with the stated aim of \"bringing peace to Afghanistan\" more than 18 years after U.S. forces pushed the Taliban out of power. </p>", "<p>\"We know that the road ahead will be difficult,\" <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/secretary-pompeos-remarks-to-the-press/\">said</a> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Thursday. \"We expected it.

It's time to sit down and talk,\" he said. </p>", "<p>President Trump also is pushing hard on the agreement. By making a phone call this week to Taliban deputy leader and co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Trump became the first American president to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/03/811722555/trump-says-he-spoke-to-taliban-leader-following-peace-agreement\">speak</a> directly with the Taliban since the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.</p>", "<p>But one leading expert on the complexities of Afghanistan cautions that Taliban fighters, having secured a peace agreement with the U.S., may not be ready yet to sit down and talk with Afghan authorities, whom they see as U.S. puppets.</p>", "<p>\"They want to indicate that they still have the capacity to fight if their demands are not met,\" says <a href=\"https://cic.nyu.edu/people/barnett-rubin\">Barnett Rubin</a>, a former State Department senior adviser on Afghanistan who directs New York University's Afghanistan-Pakistan Regional Project. \"And they have the additional incentive that President Ghani said that he will refuse to release the prisoners before the talks start. So escalating militarily is a way of trying to put pressure on him to soften his position.\"</p>", "<p><strong>'We still have confidence'</strong></p>", "<p>Rubin notes that the Taliban seem confident the U.S. will not pull the plug on a deal promising the withdrawal of all American forces within 14 months: \"I think everyone who observes Donald Trump should have concluded long ago that he's decided to get out of Afghanistan.\"</p>", "<p>Asked during Congressional testimony this week about the Taliban's renewed violence, joint chiefs chairman Gen. Mark Milley made clear he did not consider it a deal breaker.</p>", "<p>\"Yes, there was significant numbers of attacks, small attacks,\" the Pentagon's top military official <a href=\"https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/20-03-04-department-of-defense-budget-posture-\">told</a> the Senate Armed Services Committee.  \"They were all beaten back.\"</p>", "<p>Pompeo, for his part, went so far as to hail efforts to reduce violence that he said were being made by the insurgency's leaders. \"We still have confidence,\" he said Thursday, \"that the Taliban leadership was working to deliver on its commitments.\" </p>", "<p>Any commitments that may have been made to reduce violence do not appear in the four-page agreement signed in Doha. Its only reference to the ongoing fighting is a stipulation that participants in the proposed intra-Afghan negotiations \"will discuss the date and modalities of a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.\" </p>", "<p>Still, the top American commander in Afghanistan warns that the ongoing violence could imperil the Doha accord. </p>", "<p>\"If the Taliban are not going to lower violence, that causes a risk to this agreement,\" Gen. Scott Miller <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TOLOnews/status/1235122412884283392\">told </a>Afghanistan's TOLO news agency earlier this week. \"Which is why we've gone directly to the Taliban, said you need to lower your violence \u2014 otherwise, it's hard to have an agreement.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Prisoner exchange remains uncertain</strong></p>", "<p>The Doha agreement does have language specifically calling for the release of detained combatants: \"Up to five thousand (5,000) prisoners of ... the Taliban and up to one thousand (1,000) prisoners of the other side will be released by March 10, 2020, the first day of intra-Afghan negotiations.\" </p>", "<p>But a joint declaration issued by Afghan president Ashraf Ghani and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on the same day the Doha agreement was signed lacks any similar specific commitment to a prisoner release, according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-afghanistan-taliban-prisoners/differing-u-s-documents-helped-fuel-afghan-prisoner-dispute-idUSKBN20Q01D\">Reuters</a>.  It simply calls for the Afghan government's participation in a \"U.S.-facilitated discussion with Taliban representatives on confidence-building, to include determining the feasibility of releasing significant numbers of prisoners on both sides.\"</p>", "<p>\"Those aren't remotely inconsistent,\" Pompeo declared when asked about the apparent discrepancy regarding a prisoner swap between the documents the U.S. signed with the Taliban and the declaration it made in Kabul. \"These were heavily negotiated documents. All the parties understand that it's time for prisoner exchanges to take place.\"</p>", "<p>Pompeo added that the U.S. continues \"to press all sides to stop posturing, start a practical discussion about prisoner releases, knuckle down and prepare for the upcoming intra-Afghan negotiations.\"</p>", "<p>Like Pompeo, NYU's Rubin was in Doha for the signing ceremony.  He says if the document's call for the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners had not been included, the agreement would not have been signed by the insurgency. </p>", "<p>\"The Taliban understood it as a commitment by the United States to get the prisoners released. That is what they're standing firm,\" says Rubin. \"The United States is standing by the literal meaning of the words, but trying to persuade the [Afghan] government.  It is ambiguous in a way that diplomatic documents are often ambiguous.\"</p>", "<p>Despite his stated refusal to go along with the prisoner release, President Ghani did meet Friday evening with U.S. Special Representative for Afghan Reconciliation <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/biographies/zalmay-khalilzad/\">Zalmay Khalilzad</a>, the Afghan-born American diplomat who signed the agreement with the Taliban in Doha.</p>", "<p>\"Both sides talked about the future steps in the peace process,\" Ghani's spokesman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SediqSediqqi/status/1235975296135974912\">wrote</a> on Twitter, \"and [the] start of the negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban.\"</p>", "<p>While those talks are slated to begin March 10, Barnett says that's unlikely to happen without concessions.</p>", "<p>\"The Taliban will not agree to start the talks without the prisoner exchange.

That's right \u2014 1.5 billion.</p>", "<p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/tags/162395868/coronavirus\">coronavirus </a>started spreading in January, Bowen says he's gotten at least 100 calls and emails a day.</p>", "<p>\"Normally, I don't get any,\" he says.</p>", "<p>Bowen is at the center of a major problem that the coronavirus has made crystal clear: There aren't enough domestic manufacturers for critical medical supplies such as face masks. And even if production ramps up, it's unlikely to be enough in the current outbreak.</p>", "<p>Usually, businesses want orders to spike \u2014 they hope customers line up for their products.</p>", "<p>But Bowen is not pleased.</p>", "<p>His company simply can't keep up with demand. 3M \u2014 one of the biggest mask makers \u2014 is in the same predicament.

A decade ago, it ramped up production in response to the swine flu outbreak by buying more machines and hiring 150 new workers.</p>", "<p>\"We made a really big mistake,\" Bowen says of that decision. It took about four months to build the new machines, which are as long as a school bus<strong> </strong>and cost as much as $1 million.</p>", "<p>By the time they were ready, the swine flu crisis had ended, demand vaporized, and Prestige Ameritech almost went bankrupt. \"One day \u2014 and it is literally almost like one day \u2014 it just quits.

But the recent shortages also show how a lack of steady orders can create a sudden national security risk.</p>", "<p>The seeds of that problem, says Bowen, can be traced back 15 years. That's when many mask factories moved overseas, where masks could be made at a fraction of Bowen's costs.</p>", "<p>Most notably, he says, Kimberly-Clark, which used to be one of the industry leaders, moved its operations.</p>", "<p>\"The surgical mask supply went from being 90% U.S.-made to being 95% foreign-made in literally one year,\" Bowen says.</p>", "<p>For years, Bowen tried to get the government to pay attention to this issue.

Central banks in Japan and the United Kingdom are also signaling they're willing to cut rates.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate on Thursday gave final passage to a roughly $8 billion <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/812109864/bipartisan-negotiators-reach-deal-for-roughly-8-billion-for-coronavirus-response\">spending package</a> to provide medical supplies in hard-hit areas and pay for vaccine research. President Trump has said he will sign the bill.</p>", "<p>Despite such measures, many economists now say growth is likely to slow considerably this year \u2014 if not contract altogether.</p>", "<p>Goldman Sachs projected on Sunday that because of the coronavirus, the U.S. economy would grow by an anemic 0.9% during the first three months of 2020 and would flatline during the second quarter.</p>", "<p>The epidemic has already cut into growth this year and may slow the global economy even further, depending on how long it lasts, the International Monetary Fund said this week.</p>", "<p>The uncertain outlook has sent the stock market onto a tumultuous roller-coaster ride not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, with turbulent drops followed by wild swings upward.</p>", "<p>Even the Fed's interest rate cut has done little to ease the market's volatility. After Tuesday's 1,300-point drop in the Dow, stocks soared again Wednesday. But stock indexes were down sharply on Thursday.</p>", "<p>The tumult in the U.S. economy still pales in comparison to the damage being felt in other countries. In China, auto sales cratered 80% last month, while a plunge in tourism is expected to push Italy and perhaps France into a recession.  </p>", "<p>Still, the list of U.S. companies that say they're feeling the epidemic's impact grows longer every day.</p>", "<p>Procter &amp; Gamble and Ralph Lauren are among numerous companies warning that the epidemic will hurt sales because shoppers are staying home, especially in the booming consumer market of China.</p>", "<p>Others, such as Medtronic, Microsoft and Best Buy, say the virus has disrupted their supply chains in Asia and forced them to shut down production, at least temporarily. </p>", "<p>Even when factories are reopened, many companies in China report difficulty finding enough workers to staff them, according to a survey of manufacturers by <a href=\"https://www.amcham-shanghai.org/en/article/supply-chains-and-factory-openings-amcham-shanghai-mini-survey\">the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai</a>.</p>", "<p>Apple has warned that it won't meet its sales estimates for the current quarter, in part because its major suppliers, including Foxconn and Flex, remain understaffed.</p>", "<p>The industries hardest hit have been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/812026357/coronavirus-fears-lead-to-canceled-flights-and-concerns-within-the-travel-indust\">tourism and travel</a>, with many airlines canceling flights and companies such as JPMorgan Chase banning all but essential employee travel.</p>", "<p>The U.S. Travel Association predicts that international travel to the United States will fall by 6% over the next three months.</p>", "<p>\"There is a lot of uncertainty around coronavirus, and it is pretty clear that it is having an effect on travel demand \u2014 not just from China, and not just internationally, but for domestic business and leisure travel as well,\" the association's president, Roger Dow, said <a href=\"https://www.ustravel.org/press/travel-trends-index-intl-inbound-travel-plummet-6-over-next-three-months\">in a statement</a>.</p>", "<p>As more and more companies feel the pain of the epidemic, the odds of a prolonged downturn grow.</p>", "<p>\"It is not just spending on restaurants and travel that is suffering, but also investment by businesses while they wait for the uncertainty to be resolved,\" Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/opinion/coronavirus-economy-recession.html?searchResultPosition=1\">wrote in the New York Times</a> this weekend. \"This will have long-term effects on growth even if the outbreak proves short-lived.\"</p>", "<p>But epidemics like this one don't come along very often, and economists don't have any good models to figure out what might happen.

Five Turkish soldiers were killed in Idlib earlier this week and nearly a million people have been displaced in fierce fighting since December, as forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad have made gains in the opposition's last redoubt.</p>", "<p>\"I express hope that these agreements will serve as a good basis for a cessation of military activity in the Idlib de-escalation zone [and] stop the suffering of the peaceful population and the growing humanitarian crisis,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday, after talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Moscow. Erdogan pledged support for \"Syrians in need.\"</p>", "<p>The agreement, however, is unlikely to mark an end to the region's terrible suffering.</p>", "<p>\"A new deal does not mean a solution,\" says Turkey analyst Galip Dalay. It is \"a temporary freezing of the conflict.\"</p>", "<p>Dalay, a fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, does not believe there is even a medium-term plan. \"What will happen three months from now is anyone's guess.\"</p>", "<p>The question of the long term is even more difficult. Here are some key points to consider.</p>", "<p><strong>How did the situation in Idlib get so bad? </strong></p>", "<p>The problem has been simmering for years. The intensified fighting and displacement of the last few weeks were predictable, even if the timing was not. Before Syria's popular uprising turned into civil war in 2011, the province was a largely agricultural area. It became a center of opposition, but not a priority for Assad and his supporters.</p>", "<p>First, government forces and their allies retook Syria's major urban and strategic areas, with years of hard fighting. As each area was retaken \u2014 the suburbs of Damascus, the city of Homs, areas of Aleppo \u2014 deals were done that saw opposition fighters and civilians who were afraid to live under Assad's rule sent to Idlib.</p>", "<p>\n                A Turkish military convoy drives in the east of Idlib on Feb. 28.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">A Turkish military convoy drives in the east of Idlib on Feb. 28.</p>", "<p>The province's population more than doubled, to about 3 million people. Most are civilians, of whom many live in camps or rely on some form of humanitarian aid. Some are opposition fighters, among whom jihadist groups are powerful.</p>", "<p>Assad and his allies, especially Russia, are now pushing to retake Idlib. The conundrum, says Dalay, is \"the Syrian regime does want the strategic location of Idlib. But it does not want the population of Idlib.\"</p>", "<p>The prospects for that population are grim. They are mostly impoverished, and have been devastated by violence. This week, for the first time, a United Nations body directly <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=25638&amp;LangID=E\">accused Russia</a> of the \"war crime of launching indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas.\" The U.N. also says the recent mass movement of people \"represents the single largest volume of displacement since the Syrian crisis began in 2011.\"</p>", "<p>Another conundrum: The displaced have nowhere to go. Idlib borders Turkey, which has already taken in about 4 million Syrian refugees. As the Turkish economy has weakened, anti-refugee sentiment has bubbled up. Erdogan has said Turkey cannot take in any more people and has built a border wall. European leaders, too, have no stomach to accept a large number of Syrians, even those fleeing state-sponsored violence.</p>", "<p><strong>What is Assad's goal in Idlib, and how close is he to achieving it?</strong></p>", "<p>Assad has said that he will retake \"every inch\" of Syria. Although it has taken him years and come at untold cost, this seems exactly his policy in Idlib.</p>", "<p>\n                Displaced Syrian children speak with Turkish soldiers near the town of Batabu on the highway linking Idlib to the Syrian border crossing with Turkey on March 2.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Aaref Watad/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Displaced Syrian children speak with Turkish soldiers near the town of Batabu on the highway linking Idlib to the Syrian border crossing with Turkey on March 2.</p>", "<p>It may be that his recent gains happened faster than he expected. \"We were surprised to see the rapid advance,\" says a diplomat in Lebanon, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record. \"A game-changer was the intervention of Iran in western Aleppo.\"</p>", "<p>Assad's Iranian allies have been largely disengaged from Idlib, says the diplomat, preferring to focus on neighboring Aleppo province, a commercial center. But when Iranian forces expanded into western Aleppo and beyond at the beginning of this year, the setback to rebels allowed Assad loyalists to retake key roads and towns in neighboring Idlib, with Russian air support.</p>", "<p>But then, alarmed by the prospect of people approaching the border as they fled the advance, Turkey increased its support for rebels, who pushed back and retook territory. Russia, in turn, doubled down on its air campaign in support of Assad.</p>", "<p>Fighting has been ferocious in the last week, with Syria and Turkey taking and inflicting casualties and coming closer to all-out war with one another. The diplomat says Assad may want to retake Idlib and kill or expel a significant portion of the people there \u2014 but, \"I have always assumed that the fate of Idlib will depend on the Russians and the Turks. Assad wants it, but can't take it without Russian air support.\"</p>", "<p><strong>What do Presidents Putin and Erdogan want?</strong></p>", "<p>\n                Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan talk during their meeting in the Kremlin, in Moscow on Thursday.\n                \n                <b class=\"credit\" aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Pavel Golovkin/AP\n                    \n                </b>\n                <b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>", "<p class=\"caption\">Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan talk during their meeting in the Kremlin, in Moscow on Thursday.</p>", "<p>\"Turkey's most immediate goal is to make sure that another wave of refugees does not cross into Turkey,\" says Dalay.</p>", "<p>Erdogan also wants to maintain Turkey's present level of influence in Idlib, where it has troops and observation posts and de facto control over areas along the border where many displaced people are. Turkey controls much of the aid that enters. Strategically, Turkey's grip on Idlib also helps it maintain a presence in other enclaves in Syria, where it is keeping Kurdish forces \u2014 which it considers terrorists \u2014 away from its border.</p>", "<p>Turkey once imagined a powerful role for itself in a post-Assad Syria. Now it only has a \"plethora of bad options,\" says Dalay. He believes Turkey's best-case scenario now would be to succeed in persuading Western powers to enforce a no-fly zone over part of Idlib and create an enclave or buffer zone where Syrians who believe they cannot return to Assad-held areas would live under Turkey's protection, without actually crossing its borders. Some analysts have compared this scenario to the Gaza Strip \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/04/733487137/i-want-to-get-the-hell-out-of-here-thousands-of-palestinians-are-leaving-gaza\">a restricted and difficult life</a> for a large number of people.</p>", "<p>As for Russia, it wants to keep Assad in power.</p>", "<p>\"Russian policy \u2014 you might like it or not \u2014 but it has been very consistent from the beginning,\" says <a href=\"https://russiancouncil.ru/en/fedor-lukyanov/\">Fyodor Lukyanov, an analyst at the Russian International Affairs Council</a>. He says that for Putin, \"Any preservation of regime is better for regional and national security and stability than any change of regime.\"</p>", "<p>This conclusion was reached, he says, after the Kremlin watched the impact of regime change in Iraq and Libya, and that Russia is seeking to support Assad in retaking territory as close to pre-war Syria as possible. Additionally, Lukyanov says, there are several hundred jihadist fighters from Russia and post-Soviet states in Idlib, and Russia wants them \"eliminated completely.\"</p>", "<p><strong>How realistic are these scenarios?</strong></p>", "<p>The ultimate outcome could depend on the relationship between Turkey and Russia, which is \"very strange, paradoxical,\" says Lukyanov. \"It's not based on trust. It's not based on sympathy. It is based on the understanding that without at least coordination with the other side, neither of them is able to achieve any of their goals.\"</p>", "<p>The two countries have many interests beyond Syria \u2014 ranging from the conflict in Libya, where they back opposing sides, to a recently opened gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey, and arms deals. So they are prepared to negotiate and might someday reach a sustainable agreement.</p>", "<p>Although years of talks on Syria have yielded various agreements, there have also been many complaints of violations. Russia claims Turkey has failed to \"neutralize\" al-Qaida-linked groups among rebels, while Turkey says Russia targets civilians. Russia had already offered Turkey control of an area within Idlib, but it was much smaller than Turkey would have liked.</p>", "<p>Other outcomes are possible. Some observers believe people in Idlib, armed with tanks and bulldozers, could possibly breach the border. Others fear a catastrophic massacre of civilians by Assad loyalists.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Western governments, not militarily involved, have limited influence. American officials have so far ruled out helping Turkey create a no-fly zone. NATO and European leaders, too, have offered solidarity but not game-changing military support to Turkey.</p>", "<p>Some think cycles of violence are likely to continue in Idlib.</p>", "<p>\"Turkey manipulates the issue of refugees. Russia essentially behaves as if it wanted to create a new wave of refugees,\" says <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/people/middle-east/emile-hokayem\">Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Security Studies</a>. Although Europe has limited leverage in the negotiations, Hokayem says, it could find itself dealing with fallout from a fresh wave of refugees.</p>", "<p>\"We're not approaching the end of the Syrian conflict,\" he says, \"and I think we have to brace ourselves for more of this bloody instability.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

The missed lessons disproportionately affect poorer students, who often have fewer opportunities for learning outside of school. Many students rely on the free or discounted meals they eat at school for nutrition. Child care must be hastily arranged, which sometimes means that kids are left at home unattended. Dropout rates also can rise, particularly after protracted closures. And students might not have equal access to technology if their classes go online.</p>", "<p>In the U.S., only a few schools have closed so far \u2014 but that number is likely to grow.

And don't kiss.</p>", "<p>Those are two pieces of advice that could be crucial in reducing the spread of the coronavirus.</p>", "<p>Public health officials say the spread has been mainly driven through people spending time indoors with others who have the disease.</p>", "<p>\"Looks like the main driver is not widespread community infection \u2014 looks like it's household-level infection,\" Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to the World Health Organization, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1232321776928968705\">said at a news conference</a> in Geneva on Feb. 25.</p>", "<p>Indeed, data from China's cases show that most of the spread is happening among family members who live together.</p>", "<p>Perhaps the reason that the virus spreads among family members is the way people become infected. \"The main mode of transmission is respiratory droplets\" that can be produced by <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/transmission-based-precautions.html\">speaking and coughing</a>, says <a href=\"https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/microbiology-immunology/adam-lauring-md-phd\">Dr. Adam Lauring</a>, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan. \"These droplets then can find their way into the mouths, noses of other people nearby.\"</p>", "<p>(Sneezing, another way droplets are spread, is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1232321776928968705\">not a common symptom</a> of COVID-19, indicating that it's not usually an upper respiratory infection, Aylward said.)</p>", "<p>But spread isn't exclusively a family matter. The close contact that leads to infection can apply to a range of behaviors, says <a href=\"http://www.mmg.pitt.edu/person/seema-s-lakdawala\">Seema Lakdawala</a>, a virologist who studies flu transmission at the University of Pittsburgh. \"You can do it through shaking hands or kissing somebody who is sick, or you can do it through indirect contact transmission, which is through a contaminated surface, something like a doorknob or a handrail ... [or] you pick up somebody else's phone.\"</p>", "<p><strong>(To learn how Lakdawala suggests cutting down on the risk of transmission at home, </strong><a href=\"#cut_risks\"><strong>click here</strong></a><strong>.)</strong></p>", "<p>Researchers aren't sure how long droplets of the new coronavirus remain infectious on phones, but similar coronaviruses can survive on surfaces from a few hours up to a few days, depending on the environment, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses\">says the WHO</a>.</p>", "<p>Spread takes place more readily if you're within coughing range of someone sick, \"like if you're standing next to your kid and they cough in your face,\" says Lakdawala. You could breathe in the droplets. Or they may land on a surface that somebody then touches.</p>", "<p>While there's no way for health authorities to regulate family interactions, steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of close contact in crowds.</p>", "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\">WHO says</a> that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/26/809650625/a-guide-how-to-prepare-your-home-for-coronavirus\">social-distancing measures</a> \u2014 as when China extended the national Lunar New Year holiday to keep people from traveling or working, closed offices and canceled public transportation \u2014 have helped slow the transmission of the disease there. Such steps could be effective in other countries, including the U.S., where the virus is spreading in some communities.</p>", "<p>Researchers looking back at <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291415/\">prior outbreaks</a>, such as the 1957 flu pandemic and the 2003 SARS epidemic, found that public health policies that kept people from gathering in public spaces \u2014 such as closing schools and canceling big events \u2014 helped slow the spread of disease.</p>", "<p>In the current outbreak, the evidence for the way the coronavirus has spread comes from analyzing case clusters in China. Findings were published on Feb. 28 in a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\">report</a> from the WHO-China joint mission.</p>", "<p>In mid-February, a team of international experts visited areas in China hard hit by the coronavirus. The mission was co-led by Aylward and Liang Wannian, head of the expert panel for China's National Health Commission.</p>", "<p>The team toured hospitals, health clinics and community centers to determine how the coronavirus is spreading in China.</p>", "<p>Aylward says the pattern of family spread could be a big reason for China's apparent success in slowing the spread of the virus. Once one member of a family is infected, it's usually easy to find other family members who may have had close contact and then put them in quarantine for 14 days.</p>", "<p>Data from China's government show that the country's coronavirus infection rates peaked in late January and have declined ever since.</p>", "<p>Outside China, much of the spread has come from mass gatherings. On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, more than 700 passengers and crew members caught the coronavirus. More than 2,000 infections have been linked to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/24/808914718/secretive-church-sect-at-the-center-of-south-koreas-coronavirus-outbreak\">church group in South Korea</a>.</p>", "<p>\"It's very much driven by the context of a gathering\" and how people disperse after it's over, spreading it to other individuals or groups, said <a href=\"http://origin.who.int/about/who_reform/emergency-capacities/oversight-committee/michael-ryan/en/\">Dr. Michael Ryan</a>, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, at a press conference on Feb. 24.</p>", "<p>There is some encouraging news about the coronavirus' spread. So far, it seems to spread less easily than flu or measles.</p>", "<p>\"With influenza, people who are infected but not yet sick are major drivers of transmission, which does not appear to be the case for COVID-19,\" <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020\">said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</a> at a news conference on March 3. And the measles virus is so contagious that droplets can survive in the air for two hours.</p>", "<p>And you should definitely think twice before kissing. French Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran has advised people to cut back <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200229-france-bans-large-public-gatherings-to-slow-coronavirus-spread\">on cheek kissing</a>, a common greeting known as <em>la bise</em>.

On Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/student-foreign-travel.html\">colleges should \"consider\" canceling</a> both study-abroad and foreign-exchange programs, which could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of students.</p>", "<p>Almost 1 million of the nation's more than 19 million higher education students come from overseas, <a href=\"https://www.iie.org/en/Research-and-Insights/Open-Doors/Data/International-Students/Enrollment\">according to the Institute of International Education</a>. China is the <a href=\"https://www.iie.org/Research-and-Insights/Open-Doors/Data/International-Students/Places-of-Origin\">largest point of origin</a> for those students, with about 370,000 students currently enrolled. Of the other <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200301-sitrep-41-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=6768306d_2\">highly affected countries</a>, South Korea is No. 3 , Japan is No.8, and Iran is No. 13 in sending students to the U.S.</p>", "<p>At the same time, 342,000 students from the U.S. study abroad each year, according to IIE. The second-most popular destination is Italy, which, because of widespread community transmission there, now carries <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-italy\">a CDC travel warning</a>.</p>", "<p>Here are the top ways colleges and universities are coping with the spread of coronavirus:</p>", "<p><strong>1. Moving classes online</strong></p>", "<p>Amy DeCillis, a senior at NYU Shanghai, chose to stay in-country to finish out her last semester. She says she's been largely confined to her apartment complex, getting groceries delivered and taking classes online with classmates across several time zones. When she ventured out to a restaurant recently, she had to get her temperature checked at the door. And she has temporarily adopted the cat of an absent classmate.</p>", "<p>\"I'm a dog lover, but I have a COVID-cat now,\" she says.</p>", "<p>U.S.-based institutions with operations on the ground in China and Japan \u2014 including Temple University, NYU, Fort Hays State University and Sam Houston State University \u2014 had just a few weeks to <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/education/college-students-coronavirus-penn-temple-drexel-online-20200303.html\">migrate all their classes online</a> after cities came under quarantine. And colleges and universities around the United States are now asking professors to <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/02/mitigating-impacts-to-student-instruction-due-to-covid-19/\">prepare to do the same</a>, and to familiarize themselves with video conferencing programs like Zoom, in the event that an outbreak keeps students confined at home.</p>", "<p>In China, some schools are making courses accessible over mobile phone, because students may be stuck at home without laptops. And taking classes online can mean using a VPN to get around China's firewall. Heather Lee, a professor of history at NYU Shanghai, says, \"The VPN makes things really difficult.\" Because of bandwidth issues, she often resorts to using the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat to communicate with her students during online lectures.</p>", "<p>Jeff Bourgeois, a leadership professor at Fort Hays State, has gone from teaching students on their <a href=\"http://en.sias.edu.cn/\">partner campus</a> in Henan Province, China, to teaching them from 16 time zones away in San Diego. He says he can't travel to China; meanwhile, his China-based students are quarantined at home.</p>", "<p>\"I asked one of my students the other day, 'What have you been up to?' And his response was, 'Today, I took a shower. I watched a movie. And then I took a nap. Tomorrow I'll probably do the same thing.'\" Bourgeois says as the semester gets going, \"I'm hoping they fill their time with lots of homework and writing beautiful papers.\"</p>", "<p>Jeff Lehman, vice chancellor at NYU Shanghai, says there has been one silver lining: \"We have, as a faculty, been thinking more seriously about pedagogy in the last month than we have in the prior eight years.\" He says lecturing over video chat isn't always feasible because of bandwidth issues and other reasons, so professors are figuring out how to engage students by posting videos and over chat threads.</p>", "<p>He and leaders at other colleges say that lessons learned, and plans created, for their Chinese operations may become applicable stateside if the coronavirus continues to spread.</p>", "<p><strong>2. Canceling travel</strong></p>", "<p>Even before the CDC's advisory about study abroad, many colleges and state university systems began canceling both ongoing and upcoming travel programs. Among them: the <a href=\"https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/education/california-universities-suspend-study-abroad-programs-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/509-a632397f-8290-45d3-982e-be51a6a272f7\">University of California system</a>, <a href=\"https://ktar.com/story/2999796/asu-students-describe-chaotic-return-from-china-due-to-coronavirus/\">Arizona State University</a>, <a href=\"https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/03/University-of-Pittsburg-COVID-19-novel-coronavirus-study-abroad-international-spring-break/stories/202003030135\">University of Pittsburgh, Edinboro University</a>, <a href=\"https://www.whsv.com/content/news/JMU-students-returning-home-from-Italy-as-coronavirus-spreads-568409991.html\">James Madison University</a>, <a href=\"https://www.courant.com/breaking-news/hc-br-uconn-coronoavirus-italy-20200229-akkxc3lmlfbrhgxpl6npoe4lp4-story.html\">University of Connecticut, Trinity College</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tamu.edu/coronavirus/update-on-coronavirus-regarding-study-abroad-and-travel-guidelines.html\">Texas A&amp;M University</a>. Those cancellations have meant scrambling to find new spots for students on crowded campuses.</p>", "<p>Lehman at NYU says that after the school's Chinese New Year break, with coronavirus looming, hundreds of Shanghai students chose to go study on different campuses: \"The No. 1 destination, ironically, was Florence. And so actually, a number of those students have had a double bump experience. But they're troupers.\"</p>", "<p>Faculty, meanwhile, have been affected by cancellations of major meetings and academic conferences like Educause in Bellevue, Wash., and a <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-fears-cancel-physics-conference.html\">meeting of the American Physical Society</a> in Denver. <em>Science</em> magazine <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/disruption-enormous-coronavirus-epidemic-snarls-science-worldwide\">reported </a>that researchers as far away as Berkeley, Calif., are feeling the loss of ability to collaborate with colleagues in China.</p>", "<p><strong>3. Helping Chinese students</strong></p>", "<p>On Thursday, the Institute of International Education <a href=\"https://www.iie.org/Research-and-Insights/Publications/COVID%E2%80%9019-Effects-on-US-Higher-Education-Campuses\">released a survey</a> of 234 U.S. institutions that together enroll about half of all Chinese students in the United States. Of those, 37% said some of their students were forced to remain in China after traveling home for the holidays because of virus-related travel restrictions. The universities have been offering these students the chance to do independent study, take a semester off or enroll online.</p>", "<p>For Chinese students currently on American campuses, the problem is the reverse: They can't go home for spring break, or possibly for the summer. The survey found institutions are offering special counseling services and, in some cases, hotlines to report instances of discrimination.</p>", "<p>In addition, three-fourths of institutions surveyed said travel restrictions are affecting their ability to recruit students in China for upcoming years.</p>", "<p><strong>4. Issuing warnings and guidelines</strong></p>", "<p>Across the country, universities are trying to calm students, faculty and parents; 96% told IIE in their survey that they have released communitywide communications and basic health information. Students and staff coming back from overseas \u2014 and sometimes, anyone with symptoms \u2014 are being urged to self-quarantine for two weeks. Campus health centers are <a href=\"https://www.rit.edu/coronavirus\">asking for a heads up</a> if a student with symptoms believes they need to be tested for COVID-19. And professors are being reminded to <a href=\"https://uhs.berkeley.edu/guidelines-help-instructors-respond-students-who-become-ill\">encourage students</a> <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/2020/03/02/mitigating-impacts-to-student-instruction-due-to-covid-19/\">to stay home</a> if they feel sick, and not to require a doctor's note.</p>", "<p>In addition to health warnings, hand-washing reminders and cleaning tips, a common thread in campus communications about coronavirus has been to \"take an active role in rejecting xenophobia, bigotry and racism associated with COVID-19,\" as the University of California, Davis <a href=\"https://www.ucdavis.edu/health/pandemics/coronavirus/news/coronavirus-travel-warning-other-cautions/\">put it</a>.</p>", "<p><strong>5. Planning for bigger disruptions</strong></p>", "<p>For Ruth Chisum, executive director of online operations at Sam Houston State University in Texas, the coronavirus threat has meant dusting off their \"academic continuity plan\" from Hurricane Harvey in 2017.</p>", "<p>SHSU exemplifies the complex nature of higher education today: The public college near Houston serves about  20,000 students and has 51 online programs. It also happens to run a dual-degree program with Zhejiang Police College in Hangzhou, China. The program swiftly converted to online-only after the coronavirus began to spread.</p>", "<p>When it comes to their main campus, Chisum says, \"We're going to wait and see what the CDC says \u2014 what sort of mandate we receive from our federal agencies. However, it's not a passive posture in the sense that we are preparing ourselves for the possible transition of moving all of our campus-based operations to an online modality.\"</p>", "<p>During Harvey, Chisum says the school closed the main campus for only one week. However, knowing that its online students, often working parents, were facing significant life disruptions, SHSU delayed the start of the online semester until October, crunching its usual 15-week courses into 7.5-week intensives. Chisum says they'd probably do something similar in the case of coronavirus closures, since students mostly stayed on track after Harvey and revenue didn't drop as much as expected.</p>", "<p><strong>6. Teaching and learning about coronavirus</strong></p>", "<p>A global health crisis can also be a learning opportunity. In mid-February, the Imperial College London <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/covid-19\">debuted a free class</a> on the online learning platform Coursera, titled \"Science Matters: Let's Talk About COVID-19.\" The course already has more than 7,000 enrollments, making it the second most popular Coursera offering so far in 2020.</p>", "<p>As for Amy DeCillis at NYU Shanghai, she has shifted her capstone senior project to be about coronavirus and her own quarantine experience. She says she's not sorry she stayed through the quarantine: \"I'm content with my decision. It sounds cheesy, but I'm learning so much about life, and friendship, and the world, and myself in the process.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

We talked to travel and health specialists to get answers.</p>", "<p><strong>Can I cancel a trip I've booked because I'm afraid of the coronavirus? </strong></p>", "<p>Depends on whether you bought a refundable ticket or have the right kind of travel insurance. Regular travel insurance won't cover a cancellation because of fears about the coronavirus outbreak. For that, you need to buy a \"Cancel for Any Reason\" (CFAR) policy.</p>", "<p>\"They've become quite popular in the last few weeks,\" says Jonathan Breeze, CEO of AardvarkCompare, a travel insurance comparison website. \"We're seeing about a 50% increase in the amount of policies being sold.\"</p>", "<p>A few things to note: A CFAR policy typically needs to be purchased within a couple of weeks from the time you booked your trip, it will usually only cover about 75% of your costs, and New York state does not allow residents to buy CFAR policies.</p>", "<p>In addition, some credit cards have automatic travel insurance for trips purchased by their cardholders. Check with your provider to see whether you would be covered.</p>", "<p><strong>How do I pick a travel insurance policy?</strong></p>", "<p>There is no one-size-fits-all policy, according to Christopher Elliott, founder of a consumer advocacy organization, <a href=\"https://www.elliott.org/blog/best-travel-insurance-policies/\">Elliott Advocacy</a>. Factors such as your age, the length of your trip and what you want covered all figure into the decision. Elliott recommends reading the insurance contract before buying to check whether it applies to \"worst-case scenarios,\" such as sickness or flight delays. <a href=\"https://www.elliott.org/blog/need-travel-insurance-read-this/\">See this column for more advice.</a></p>", "<p><strong>What if I booked a flight and want to reschedule it to avoid traveling during the outbreak?</strong></p>", "<p>Several airlines \u2014 including American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue and United \u2014 have been waiving change fees for flights purchased between certain dates. And even if your purchase falls outside that window, \"it's always worth asking,\" says Seth Kaplan, transportation analyst for WBUR's Here &amp; Now. \"You're asking for an exception,\" he says \u2014 but if you're polite and explain your situation, you might get a break.</p>", "<p><strong>What if I want to end my trip early, say, because the outbreak has spread to a country I'm visiting?</strong></p>", "<p>In most cases, \"somebody abroad saying, 'I don't wish to be here anymore,' isn't covered by regular travel insurance,\" says Breeze. Again, this is where a Cancel for Any Reason policy would come in handy. With many CFAR policies, a traveler can not only recover some of the initial cost of the trip, he says, but in many cases, the policy will also cover the additional cost of coming home.</p>", "<p><strong>Is international travel riskier to my health than domestic travel?</strong></p>", "<p>It depends.<a href=\"https://www.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/physiciandirectory/shira-doron?dpt=c1b92da7-2a63-4c04-975b-96f89d8410af\"> Shira Doron</a>, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Tufts Medical Center, says she would not recommend traveling to countries that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has put on its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/29/810440382/map-which-countries-have-cdc-travel-advisories-because-of-coronavirus\">\"warning\" list </a>to avoid nonessential travel, such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea.</p>", "<p>But that doesn't mean domestic travel is risk-free. To put things in perspective, the virus is here, with case numbers on the rise.</p>", "<p>\"We already have community transmission within the United States,\" says Doron. \"So, at some point, it's not going to be any riskier to go to another country than it is to stay right here.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Since the virus is already out there, should I avoid plane travel just to be safe? After all, when you fly aren't you breathing in recycled air?</strong></p>", "<p>\"The air's actually pretty clean. It gets recirculated through these <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-hepa-filter-1\">HEPA filters</a> that really are very good at clearing stuff out,\" says <a href=\"http://nursing.emory.edu/directory/assets/biopdf/vhertzb-CV.pdf\">Vicki Hertzberg</a>, director of Emory University's Center for Nursing Data Science, who co-led a study on flights and disease transmission with scientists at Boeing. \"So in some aspects, the air on a plane is cleaner than what's going on in your new office buildings.\"</p>", "<p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.beverlyhospital.org/about-us/hospital-leadership\">Dr. Mark Gendreau</a>, chief medical officer at Beverly Hospital in Massachusetts, says that airlines have a high incentive to keep their ventilation systems well-maintained: \"If the HEPA filter is not changed regularly, if the system is not maintained well, it puts a lot of drag on the engines, which will increase the fuel consumption, which is quite an expensive proposition.\"</p>", "<p>Another important thing to know: The new coronavirus is not airborne. Instead, it's transmitted through droplets of fluid or mucus that you cough or sneeze out, which generally don't travel farther than 6 feet. But if those droplets land on a surface that you later touch, you can pick up the virus that way.</p>", "<p>People can help protect themselves and one another by taking precautions such as washing hands frequently, coughing into an elbow and trying not to touch eyes, nose and mouth.</p>", "<p>\"Good hand hygiene is the solution,\" Doron says.</p>", "<p>And not just in the bathroom. Even on the way back to your seat after a bathroom visit where you washed your hands, \"one may be touching doors, doorknobs, seats,\" says Dr. Lin Chen, president of the <a href=\"https://www.istm.org/\">International Society of Travel Medicine</a> and director of the travel medicine center at <a href=\"https://www.mountauburnhospital.org/find-a-provider/profile/lin-chen/\">Mount Auburn Hospital</a> in Massachusetts. So it's a good idea to use hand sanitizer at your seat before eating pretzels or sweeping hair from your face.</p>", "<p>The CDC says your sanitizer should have at least <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html\">60% alcohol content</a>.</p>", "<p><strong>How clean are planes anyway?</strong></p>", "<p>Airline sanitization is also something to consider. Some airlines are stepping up their cleaning game. <a href=\"http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-Update-on-China-Flights-OPS-DIS/default.aspx?reportedLocation=homePage.do&amp;reportedPosition=1&amp;reportedTitle=Coronavirus%3a+Latest+information&amp;repositoryName=PromotionContentRepository&amp;repositoryId=200375232&amp;locale=en_US\">American Airlines</a> says it is conducting a \"more thorough cleaning of all hard surfaces\" and removing self-serve snack baskets on some international flights. <a href=\"https://blog.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/coronavirus/\">Alaska Airlines</a> says that, since March 2, it has been \"enhancing\" aircraft cleaning between flights. For planes whose schedules allow, the cleaning policy now includes seats, overhead air vents, bathroom door handles, window shades and luggage compartment handles.</p>", "<p>Flights often turn around quickly, which could lead to possible lapses in the cleaning process, so Chen suggests bringing alcohol wipes to clean the areas you personally touch \u2014 including your seat belt, tray table and armrests. In a pinch, squeezing hand sanitizer onto a tissue and wiping down your armrest would probably work, she says.</p>", "<p>\"We really don't have data about how long the coronavirus survives on surfaces,\" Chen says. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses\">Other coronaviruses</a> can last for a few hours or a few days on different materials, so for the time being, \"it's best to be more cautious,\" she says.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.wbur.org/inside/staff/adrian-ma__;!!Iwwt!E2y4QaDTfAXR_5IkXY5j56e5nsJ9VKaxpEaPjy0tUtsBNorOa8wm3izm260q%24\"><em>Adrian Ma</em></a><em> is a reporter for WBUR's </em><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.wbur.org/bostonomix__;!!Iwwt!E2y4QaDTfAXR_5IkXY5j56e5nsJ9VKaxpEaPjy0tUtsBNorOa8wm3lNZYzbM%24\"><em>Bostonomix</em></a><em> team.

You can </em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money\">sign up here</a>.</p>", "<p>Last month, Daniel Tamasi, an IT manager in St. Louis, Missouri, decided he wanted to take some extra precautions against coronavirus. He has a two-year old, and he and his wife are expecting, so he started searching online for masks to protect his family. \"I thought it was going to be my usual two-to-three minute Amazon search and, you know, I'd be done with it,\" he says.  </p>", "<p>He quickly found out that Amazon didn't offer its standard, two-day shipping for Prime members like him. In fact, the earliest he could find a delivery was about a month out. \"So I went to the online stores of basically every major pharmacy \u2014 CVS, Walgreens, Target, and those sort of places \u2014 and they were all out of stock.\" Next he tried brick-and-mortar retailers around St. Louis. Still no luck.  </p>", "<p>Finally, Tamasi turned to eBay. He searched for masks there, and they were crazy expensive. The cheapest masks he could find on eBay, he says, were about four times their typical sticker price.  </p>", "<p>Around the world, people like Tamasi are scrambling for masks, and prices are rising. According to online price tracker Keepa, a 30-pack of 3M's popular N95 mask was selling on Amazon for <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/keepa.com/*!product/1-B000GUP7X4__;Iw!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CFEfaLOXw%24\">$199.95</a> last Tuesday. Normally, it's about 15 bucks. According to Nielsen, a retail tracker, sales of medical masks have seen a 319% surge in national sales over the last month compared to the same time last year. And <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-face-masks-prestige-ameritech-demand/__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CFCS22dgQ%24\">manufacturers are struggling</a> to supply the demand.  </p>", "<p>For economists like George Mason's Tyler Cowen, this is all the sign of a properly functioning market. Higher prices are the market's way of screaming: We need more masks!  \"The normal economic view is that prices should be left free to make supply and demand equal,\" Cowen says.  </p>", "<p>Higher mask prices, he says, have at least two benefits. One is that people who need them the most are more likely to get them. At this moment, the CDC only recommends masks for medical professionals, and <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.washingtonpost.com/health/shortages-confusion-and-poor-communication-complicate-coronavirus-preparations/2020/02/25/d9e56396-575d-11ea-9b35-def5a027d470_story.html__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CGrR4aZaQ%24\">hospitals</a> are running out. Those in the medical field, Cowen says, \"are the ones willing to pay the most,\" and higher prices might cut down on frivolous buying by the general public. Higher prices are also a signal to manufacturers to make more masks.  </p>", "<p>There are obviously downsides to higher prices. Merchants are profiteering on fear, and higher prices mean only the more affluent can afford masks. \"There is a genuine, legitimate fairness concern,\" Cowen says.  </p>", "<p>A <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/consumer.findlaw.com/consumer-transactions/price-gouging-laws-by-state.html__;!!Iwwt!Di96otvLILd_cOsKtuux0duuV8DHN26ym3UUapEjZakdMKMqbyjA0CEKDHvdSg%24\">majority of states</a> around the country have laws against price gouging.

For Cowen, the solution to the mask shortage is letting the market set the price. \"Arguably, it would be better for the country and the world to let the price of the masks go higher. But Amazon is selfishly preserving its reputation.\"  </p>", "<p>As for Daniel Tamasi, he ended up getting his masks. He paid $50 for a box.

Last year, it adds, a dozen foreign correspondents were given credentials valid for less than six months, even though such short-term visas normally are issued for a full year. Among the affected U.S. news organizations were <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, Voice of America and <em>The New York Times</em>. <br><br>\"The influence and pressure brought to bear on foreign journalists in China,\" the report concludes, \"reflects how Chinese authorities extend their reach and scope in chilling ways to ensure the 'China story' has but one narrative \u2014 theirs.\"<br><br>According to the State Department, the Chinese state media organizations designated foreign missions have until March 6 to inform U.S. authorities which employees will be cut to meet the new personnel caps.

Can the \"King of Israel\" \u2014 as his diehard supporters like to chant \u2014 find a way to extend his reign?</p>", "<p>His veritable throne has been wobbling in the past year. Bribery allegations led to an indictment. Onetime allies turned against him, mounting the strongest challenge yet to his political survival. Election after election ended in stalemate.</p>", "<p>Despite these setbacks, he gained an edge in Monday's election. With most votes counted \u2014 and the highest voter turnout in years \u2014 Netanyahu's Likud party finished first in the race, with more votes than in the previous two elections.</p>", "<p>Netanyahu has hailed it the \"biggest win\" of his life. Now he is emboldened. But he is without a clear path to forming a government, and his corruption trial is scheduled to begin later this month. What happens next?</p>", "<p>Here are some takeaways from the vote and questions to consider going forward.</p>", "<p><strong>How close is Netanyahu to victory?</strong></p>", "<p>With 99% of votes counted, the Likud party is projected to win 36 parliamentary seats. Netanyahu's main rival, the centrist Blue and White coalition led by retired army Gen. Benny Gantz, is projected to win 33 seats. Neither candidate has a sure path to building a majority coalition. Netanyahu and his right-wing and religious partners only seem to have captured 58 seats \u2014 three seats short of the 61 seats needed for a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, Israel's parliament.</p>", "<p>In terms of the popular vote, however, parties running against Netanyahu collectively won 125,000 more votes than pro-Netanyahu parties.</p>", "<p>For instance, the third-largest bloc in the Knesset, the Arab Joint List, gained strength as Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel voted in high numbers for the Arab coalition of parties that opposes Netanyahu. Taken together, anti-Netanyahu votes could restrict the incumbent's options for forming a government.</p>", "<p><strong>How did Netanyahu pick up more votes this time?</strong></p>", "<p>For years, Netanyahu has rallied nationalist and ultra-religious sectors of society, with a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/19/630368973/israel-passes-controversial-law-reserving-national-self-determination-for-jews\">nationality law</a> and recent promises to annex land that Palestinians want for a future state. In the runup to this election, he appealed to untapped constituencies, from taxi drivers to Ethiopian Jewish immigrants. He made an effort to drag more of his supporters to the polls \u2014 and to take votes away from Gantz. Netanyahu shared unfounded rumors about his rival, and attacked Israel's Arab lawmakers. He also touted <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/19/806978443/israel-is-eager-to-annex-west-bank-lands-but-u-s-says-to-wait-for-israeli-electi\">President Trump's Mideast peace plan</a> as a boon for Israel. Some right-wing voters who voted for Gantz's platform of change in the previous election are thought to have returned to vote for Netanyahu this time.</p>", "<p><strong>What are some possible outcomes?</strong></p>", "<p>Likud is courting politicians from other parties to persuade them to defect. If Netanyahu can lure a few lawmakers from Gantz's corner to cross the aisle and join his administration, he'll have a clear path to forming a government. Some of those lawmakers are right wing and could easily fit in a Netanyahu government. Netanyahu may also seek to bring back former ally Avigdor Lieberman, who has blocked his previous attempts at forming a government this past year. But most of these candidates were united by their desire to unseat Netanyahu and may not be willing to become his lifeline.</p>", "<p>Gantz, a former military chief who vowed to restore civility to a divided country, has not yet conceded defeat but has no clear path to forming a majority coalition. If he or other opposition parties refuse to join a Netanyahu government, Israel's political deadlock could continue, with no candidate able to form a governing majority. That could lead to yet another election.</p>", "<p>But many Israelis have voting fatigue. If no other party crosses the aisle, runner-up Gantz could be under pressure to compromise, so as not to be blamed for a fourth national election.</p>", "<p>On election night, Netanyahu called for national reconciliation, appearing to leave the door open for Gantz to join his government. If Gantz agrees, he would have to renege on his vow not to serve under an indicted prime minister.</p>", "<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>", "<p>After official election results are presented on March 10, Israel's president will hold consultations with parties, and by March 17 he must ask a candidate to try to form a government. He is likely to tap Netanyahu, since he appears to have the best chance of forming one. Then Netanyahu would get a maximum of 42 days to negotiate with potential partners on joining his coalition in exchange for cabinet jobs and policy promises.</p>", "<p>But on March 17, Netanyahu is scheduled to appear in court for the start of his trial. He'd be the first sitting prime minister to be tried in court. He faces charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes for alleged deals to wield secret control over media outlets. He denies wrongdoing.</p>", "<p>If Netanyahu is tapped to try to form a government, Israel's Supreme Court would likely be asked to rule whether an indicted man may form a government. By law Netanyahu is not required to resign, but it's a crisis Israel has never before faced. And on Wednesday, Gantz's spokesman told NPR his party is considering proposing legislation to prevent an indicted prime minister from remaining in office.</p>", "<p><strong>Could Israel's judiciary bring down Netanyahu?</strong></p>", "<p>If the Supreme Court rules that Netanyahu's indictment disqualifies him from forming a government, it will outrage his supporters, who accuse the court of left-wing, \"deep state\" attempts to bring him down.</p>", "<p>On the other hand, if Netanyahu is allowed to serve a new term, his allies vow to curb the judiciary's powers so lawmakers can overturn future Supreme Court decisions. Plus, his government would be tasked with appointing a new attorney general, state prosecutor and police chief \u2014 officials overseeing the very institutions that have investigated Netanyahu. The prime minister or his appointees could try to delay his trial or pass a law putting off his trial until he leaves office.</p>", "<p><strong>What could happen to President Trump's Mideast peace plan?</strong></p>", "<p>If Netanyahu succeeds in building a right-wing coalition, he promises to annex Jewish settlements and other occupied land in the West Bank at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That would face stiff opposition from most countries and from Palestinians, who say it would be a fatal blow to the possibility of building a viable Palestinian state in the West Bank.</p>", "<p>President Trump encouraged Israel's unilateral annexation moves in his Middle East peace plan, and U.S. and Israeli officials have already started working on drawing up annexation maps. But if Netanyahu only manages to build a slim majority government, he may not have enough support to fulfill such a bold move.</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

At least eight provinces and regions <a href=\"http://china.caixin.com/2020-02-24/101519446.html\">downgraded</a> their emergency levels, loosening the most draconian restrictions on movement to allow people to leave their homes and return to work.

First, Xusheng provided officials with a full list of employees, which in turn was vetted using \"big data methods,\" says Zhao. Then workers had to enter their national ID numbers and phone numbers into a new provincial app created as part of virus control efforts, which identifies the cities and provinces they visited in the previous two weeks. Xusheng Auto must quarantine for two weeks anyone who spent time in a heavily infected area, before allowing them to enter the factory.</p>", "<p>To protect healthy workers, the automaker also had to show teams of inspectors that it is stocked with masks and disinfectants, and has enough space to serve as quarantine wards.</p>", "<p>Michael Chen, a manager at an electronics manufacturing plant in the neighboring province of Jiangsu, says his company has rented an entire hotel \u2014 now empty because there are no travelers \u2014 to quarantine his returning workers.

Especially lower-ranking officials, they don't have incentives to work on their own, because the risk is if they are at odds with central policy, from central decision making, they may be purged.\"<strong> </strong></p>", "<p>Calls by the central government to ease access to loans and delay paying off corporate debts are also a sharp reversal from earlier instructions passed on to local governments. \"They've been told the entire year to focus on poverty alleviation, to focus on financial de-risking, which means they were originally under the impression to lower credit,\" explains Feng.</p>", "<p>Even if business owners manage to secure reopening permits, widespread labor shortages are still hampering full resumption of national production.

For instance, at a Feb. 24 news conference in Beijing, a top Chinese health official, Liang Wannian, said the fatality rate for COVID-19 was quite high.</p>", "<p>\"Between 3 to 4% of patients have died,\" said Liang. </p>", "<p>Then he added a twist. Outside of Wuhan \u2014 the city at the epicenter of the outbreak \u2014 the death rate in China has been much lower: about 0.7%. That's fewer than 1 fatality per 100 cases.</p>", "<p data-pym-loader data-child-src=\"https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/covid-fatality-china-column-20200303/\" id=\"responsive-embed-covid-fatality-china-column-20200303\"> Loading... </p>", "<p>Similarly, a study released by China's Center for Disease Control last month found that if you factor out all the data from Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, the fatality rate in the rest of China drops to 0.4%. </p>", "<p>Why such a big difference between Hubei and the rest of China? </p>", "<p>At a news conference the next day, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/adg/aylward/en/\">Dr. Bruce Aylward</a> \u2014 who had just concluded a fact-finding mission to China for the World Health Organization \u2014 pointed to three likely factors.</p>", "<p>First, said Aylward, is that Wuhan suffered from being the first place where the new coronavirus surfaced. \"Wuhan started fast and, and early. People didn't know what we were dealing with. We were learning how to treat this.\" </p>", "<p>The more patients medical staff saw, the more they could start identifying what kind of supportive care made a difference. So by the time patients started showing up in hospitals in other provinces, doctors and nurses there had a lot more information about what it takes to keep patients alive. </p>", "<p>Hospitals in the rest of world will likely also benefit from that knowledge.</p>", "<p>The second reason for the higher death rate in Hubei \"was just the sheer scale of the numbers,\" said Aylward.</p>", "<p>Hospitals in Wuhan were flooded with thousands of sick people. That stressed their capacity to provide the kind of round-the-clock intensive care needed for a patient with a critical case of COVID-19. </p>", "<p>Elsewhere in China the caseload was much lower. </p>", "<p>The implication for other countries: It's worth trying to at least slow the pace of an outbreak with measures to keep the number of patients from overwhelming local hospitals.</p>", "<p>The final factor, says Aylward, \"At the beginning of this outbreak remember, people were finding severe disease. And that's why the alarm bells went off.\"</p>", "<p>Those early severe cases made COVID-19 look like a much bigger killer. It was only after officials in China stepped up surveillance that they started uncovering many more mild cases (people with symptoms such as fever and dry cough but limited or no pneumonia). </p>", "<p>All of this may also help explain why over time the death rate for COVID-19 has steadily dropped.</p>", "<p>According to the China CDC study, among patients whose symptoms started between Jan. 1 and Jan. 10 the death rate was 15.6%. But it was just 0.8% among those who didn't get sick until Feb. 1 to Feb. 11.</p>", "<p>That pattern of progressively dropping death rates is one we're likely to see in other countries. </p>", "<p>In other words, there's a good chance the fatality rate in nations with good health systems will end up being a lot lower than what was first seen in China.</p>", "<p>Still, it's worth noting that even after China got the death rate down to 0.7%, or even 0.4%, that's still about four to seven times greater than the death rate for seasonal flu. (The rate for the flu is about 0.1% \u2014 or 1 in 1,000 patients.)</p>", "<p>Also, the China CDC study shows that for coronavirus patients ages 70 to 79 the death rate more than triples. For those older than 80 it's more than six times as high.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.mville.edu/profile/anna-yeung-cheung\">Anna Yeung-Cheung</a>, a microbiologist at Manhattanville College in New York, says she also worries about health workers. </p>", "<p>Yeung-Cheung, who is originally from Hong Kong, notes that many doctors there died during the SARS coronavirus outbreak of 2002-2003. And hundreds of Chinese health workers have been sickened in the COVID-19 outbreak \u2014 possibly, at least in part, because they were working so hard, she says.</p>", "<p>Sure, says Yeung-Cheung, \"They're young. But we need to take into account the stress that they are undergoing. This is stress to their body.\"</p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

The fatality marks the first reported death from the virus in the United States.</p>", "<p>The patient who died was a man in his 50s with underlying medical conditions, according to Washington state health officials. </p>", "<p>Also at the press conference, Vice President Pence, who has been put in charge of the country's coronavirus response, announced that the U.S. would elevate an advisory to Americans to not travel to highly affected parts of Italy and South Korea. Pence also announced an expansion to the already existing travel restrictions on Iran, which also has a high number of cases. </p>", "<p>Since the start of the month, the State Department has advised U.S. citizens not to travel to China, where the outbreak started. Most of the U.S. cases involved people who had traveled to China or abroad.</p>", "<p>Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed the first possible outbreak in a nursing facility, also in Washington state. This is unrelated to the patient who died.</p>", "<p>So far, two people at the  facility \u2014 one health worker and one resident \u2014 have tested positive. More than 50 workers and residents are showing symptoms of respiratory infection. Some are being hospitalized, and all are currently being tested. None of the new presumptive cases were related to travel, which health officials say could be an indication of the virus spreading within the community. In this localized area, officials say the risk to the public is increasing, although nationwide, the risk remains low.</p>", "<p>At a separate press conference in King County, Wash., Jeffrey Duchin, the health officer for public health in Seattle and King County, said the confirmed cases are likely just \"the tip of the iceberg.\"  </p>", "<p>Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency on Saturday, saying it \"is a time to take common-sense, proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of those who live in Washington state.\" </p>", "<p>Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, indicated at the press conference at the White House that the person who died did not have any link to foreign travel. The death comes soon after U.S. health officials began warning the public that the coronavirus now appears to be spreading within the country from person to person, independent of travel to affected areas around the world. The CDC acknowledged <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/28/810452948/who-says-risk-of-covid-19-is-now-very-high-at-a-global-level\">three other such cases</a>, known as community spread, in the U.S. late Friday night.</p>", "<p>Speaking at Saturday afternoon's press conference, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told the public to brace themselves for more cases in the country. Redfield also said to expect more cases, describing them as likely to occur in \"clusters\" in the days ahead.</p>", "<p>\"You should not be surprised by that,\" Fauci said. \"That is something that is anticipated when you get community spread.\"</p>", "<p>The new cases bring the total number of confirmed cases within the United States to more than 60; 44 of those cases originated aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship and three other cases involve people who were brought back from Wuhan, China, where the first cases were diagnosed. Excluding those who were aboard the cruise ship or brought back from China, Trump said 22 patients within the U.S. have the coronavirus, four of whom are \"very ill.\" Another 15 are either fully recovered or are \"well on their way,\" according to the president. </p>", "<p>\"So healthy people, if you're healthy, you will probably go through a process and you'll be fine,\" Trump said. \"There's no reason to panic at all.\"</p>", "<p>Trump said the person who died in Washington state was a woman in her 50s; Washington state health officials later said the person was a man in his 50s.</p>", "<p>The novel coronavirus continues to spread around the globe, including a massive surge in South Korea, where more than <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd\">800 new cases</a> were confirmed between Friday and Saturday and more than 3,000 people are now confirmed to have the virus.

Federal health officials now say <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/02/27/809936132/cdc-fixes-issue-delaying-coronavirus-testing-in-u-s\">they have resolved</a> the issue and are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0228-COVID-19-update.html\">now working to distribute</a> new test kits across the country.</p>", "<p>Additionally, the University of California, Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, where one of the cases not linked to foreign travel is being treated, says that patient didn't meet the CDC's threshold to approve a coronavirus test at first and so diagnosis was delayed for days. The CDC <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/02/28/810520187/cdc-defends-its-handling-of-new-coronavirus-case-in-california\">defended that delay</a>, saying CDC guidelines were broad for travelers but not for people within the U.S. </p>", "<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/science/1957818/union-says-124-hospital-workers-sent-home-because-of-uc-davis-coronavirus-patient\">124 health care workers</a> who were likely exposed to the virus at that same UC Davis medical center were sent home and told by the hospital to quarantine themselves. The workers, who have complied with the order and are being paid, view the hospital's actions as a system failure, according to a report by KQED.</p>", "<p>In total, more than 2,800 people worldwide have died from the virus so far, mostly in China, where the death rate is estimated to be around 2 percent, much lower than the death rates for previous coronavirus outbreaks like severe acute respiratory syndrome or  Middle East respiratory syndrome, which had death rates of 10% and 34% respectively. The death rate of this new coronavirus could also be lower than it appears if mild cases are not being reported. </p>", "<p>Despite what could be the start of community spread, people in the U.S. do not need to change their day-to-day habits, according to Redfield. </p>", "<p>\"The country as a whole ... still remains at low risk,\" Fauci said. \"But when we say that, we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation.\"</p>", "<p>Health officials maintain that among <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/27/810016611/coronavirus-101-what-you-need-to-know-to-prepare-and-prevent\">the best ways to prevent</a> the spread of the novel coronavirus are the same as those to prevent the seasonal flu: Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching your face and stay home when feeling sick. </p>", "<p class=\"contributors-text\"><em>NPR's Martin Kaste, Richard Harris and Selena Simmons-Duffin contributed to this report.</em></p>", "<p class=\"left\">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>", "<p class=\"right\"><a href=\"/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship\">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>"]}

Banners have urged citizens to take land from landlords and redistribute it to farmers. Their rhyming Chinese slogans championed non-intellectualism during the Cultural Revolution of the 1970s: \"The more knowledge you have, the more counter-revolutionary you are\"). They've reinforced presidential initiatives. \"If you want less diseases, the toilet revolution is the answer\" embraces President Xi's call for improving unhygienic bathroom conditions.</p>", "<p>When it comes to coronavirus, sometimes the tone is straightforward:</p>", "<p>\"Better to wear a mask than a ventilator; better to stay at home than in an ICU.\"</p>", "<p>Others are more dramatic:</p>", "<p>\"Those who gather together are shameless; those who play mahjong are daredevils.\"</p>", "<p>\"Have a bite of a wild animal dish today, see you in hell tomorrow.\"</p>", "<p>And some are kinda funny.</p>", "<p>\"Never ever go to grocery stores as long as you have a scallion at home.\"</p>", "<p>\"Stay in and don't wander around.

He has led the country as it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/711017460/israels-decade-of-netanyahu\">turned politically further to the right</a> during a period of economic growth. He hardened Israel's policies toward Palestinians and became a leading ally of President Trump, who has sweetened Netanyahu's reelection campaign with diplomatic gestures and Oval Office photo ops. Now Netanyahu is fighting to hang on under a cloud of corruption charges.</p>", "<p>To solidify his grip on power, Netanyahu <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/04/06/710017068/heres-what-to-know-about-israels-upcoming-elections\">called April elections</a> in which he failed to win enough support in parliament to form a new government. So he orchestrated a repeat vote \u2014 a stunning blitz to block the centrist candidate, retired Gen. Benny Gantz, from taking his job.</p>", "<p>In the second elections, neither Netanyahu's Likud party nor Gantz's Blue and White coalition had enough votes to form a government, and they couldn't agree on a power-sharing deal. Now Israelis are being dragged into a third exasperating round of elections.</p>", "<p><strong>Why's it so hard to form a government?</strong></p>", "<p>Eight main parties or coalitions of parties are vying for votes in Israel's legislative elections, and none is expected to win a majority of parliament's 120 seats. Whichever front-runner can form a majority coalition with other parties is the victor.</p>", "<p>For years, Netanyahu has managed to stay in office by partnering with mostly right-wing and religious Jewish parties. A slightly larger share of Israelis voted for those parties in the past year. But one right-wing party, led by former Defense Minister<em> </em>Avigdor Lieberman, no longer supports Netanyahu,<strong> </strong>leaving the incumbent without a majority. Netanyahu has acted as interim prime minister while the elections have been inconclusive.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Gantz hasn't been able to muster his own center-left majority in parliament, hence the political standoff.</p>", "<p><strong>Will the results be any different this time or is Israel destined for a fourth round of elections?</strong></p>", "<p>Brace yourself for a possible fourth election. A Likud party campaign official tells NPR the party is even saving campaign funds in case there is another vote.</p>", "<p>Friday's opinion polls, the last to be published before the election, suggest another stalemate between Netanyahu and Gantz. None of the parties seem willing to budge from their ideological corner to tip the scales.</p>", "<p>There are some new factors that could work against Netanyahu. He has been indicted for alleged bribery and fraud, his corruption trial is scheduled to begin in two weeks and the charges could cause some of his right-wing allies to defect to Gantz's camp. Or justice officials could rule it would be improper for an indicted prime minister to form a new government. Gantz, whose slogan is \"We Must Move Forward,\" claims Netanyahu would weaken democratic institutions if reelected and promises to heal Israeli society after Netanyahu's divisive years.</p>", "<p>Other factors work in Netanyahu's favor. He hasn't seen his support slip much. He remains defiant against the justice system, touts his close ties with President Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/04/01/708206468/netanyahus-tough-election-campaign-approach-appears-to-channel-trump\">as in the previous votes</a> and convinces his right-wing supporters his opponent is tainted by the support of Arab parties. He is running an effective reelection campaign, appealing to swing voters such as Ethiopian Jewish immigrants and gathering Likud supporters' telephone numbers for a massive get-out-the-vote drive. His Likud party has a phone app aiming to draw potential voters who don't normally go to the polls, though it inadvertently made some of their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/world/middleeast/israeli-voters-leak.html\">personal information vulnerable</a> to hackers.</p>", "<p>Turnout could be key. Many Israelis are tired of the repeated elections and could stay home, which could affect the vote. In the previous round, Gantz's supporters came to the polls in a bigger percentage than did Netanyahu's.</p>", "<p><strong>Will President Trump's Mideast peace plan affect the vote?</strong></p>", "<p>Though the Trump administration's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800296507/white-house-to-unveil-mideast-peace-plan-despite-palestinian-rejection\">proposal for peace </a>heavily favors Israel, and Netanyahu has touted it on the campaign trail to win over the right-wing, polls suggest it may not have tilted the vote.</p>", "<p>The Trump proposal gives a green light for Israel to defy objections in the international community and annex Jewish settlements and other lands in the West Bank, occupied territory the Palestinians seek for their independent state. But the move got <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/19/806978443/israel-is-eager-to-annex-west-bank-lands-but-u-s-says-to-wait-for-israeli-electi\">complicated quickly for Netanyahu</a> and the White House, which told Israel to hold off on annexation for now, leading Netanyahu's settler supporters to question if Netanyahu would ever pull it off.</p>", "<p>Gantz's party does not want to rush on annexation without international approval. Most countries regard Israeli settlements and land annexation as violations of international law.</p>", "<p>Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel may be motivated by Trump's plan to show up to the polls Monday, weakening Netanyahu's chances of winning. The proposal suggests the \"triangle\" area in northern Israel with a large concentration of Arab Israeli citizens could be given to a future Palestinian state, angering some Arab voters who seek equality in Israel.</p>", "<p><strong>How are Palestinians affected by the vote?</strong></p>", "<p>Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank do not have Israeli citizenship and do not get to vote in Monday's elections. Neither do Palestinians in Gaza. But the outcome of the vote will directly affect their lives.</p>", "<p>If Netanyahu wins and carries out his promise to annex West Bank lands, it would be an explosive move that Palestinian leaders would see as a nail in the coffin of a viable independent Palestinian state, distancing the sides from any compromise, perhaps leading to violence or increased calls for citizenship within Israel, a nightmare scenario for most Israelis.</p>", "<p>Some Palestinians see little difference between the candidates and say Israeli discriminatory policies will continue. But Palestinian officials close to President Mahmoud Abbas are said to favor Gantz, who may take a more conciliatory approach with Palestinian leaders. And yet, Gantz has many former Netanyahu supporters on his party list who oppose concessions to Palestinians.</p>", "<p>Ironically, Hamas in Gaza has benefitted lately from Netanyahu, who is hawkish toward the Palestinians but nevertheless has allowed cash into Gaza and eased Israeli restrictions on Gazans in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/20/797870734/israel-hamas-aim-to-reduce-hostilities-as-gaza-restraints-eased\">a deal to reduce violence</a>.
