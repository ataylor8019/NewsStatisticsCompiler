一个武汉人的心声——"我正活在地狱中"
	total word count: 144
	unique word count: 143
	individual word counts: 
		NPR: 2
		一位武汉的居民: 1
		编者注: 1
		出于担心中国政府会因为其批评而实施报复: 1
		本篇文章的作者要求匿名投稿: 1
		中国武汉的政府封锁令已经清空了这座城市的街道: 1
		作为一名武汉人: 1
		我和我的家人正活在地狱中: 1
		马上封城接近一个月: 1
		每天晚上睡觉之前: 1
		我还是有一种不真实感: 1
		现在的这个人间地狱到底是怎么造成的: 1
		我在中国生活了快30年: 1
		我和我的家人一直努力想要拥有更好的生活: 1
		我们告诉自己再努力一点就能成为中产阶级: 1
		可是随后的生活并没有如我的愿: 1
		从小我就努力的学习: 1
		考上了中国最棒的新闻专业: 1
		我的梦想是当一名记者: 1
		可是当我发现我因为政府管制实现我梦想的时候: 1
		我选择了放弃: 1
		我以为这样就能换来安稳的生活: 1
		因为我不断的告诉自己: 1
		我通过辛勤的工作为为他们缴纳高昂的税款并且不发表任何关于政治的言论: 1
		那么我就是安全的: 1
		我不会成为少数的倒霉蛋: 1
		直到今天我发现: 1
		这是幻梦: 1
		原来成为倒霉蛋是不需要理由的: 1
		在目前的政治体制以内: 1
		没有言论自由: 1
		就没有安稳生活: 1
		在封城的那一刻: 1
		我也满怀希望这个号称: 1
		集中办大事: 1
		的极端政体能够在故意隐瞒导致错过防控最佳期对武汉人民进行补救: 1
		可惜我又一次感到了绝望: 1
		早在12月初就已经有患者到医院就诊: 1
		不知出于何种理由他们一直没有对外公布: 1
		也没有采取任何的有效措施: 1
		最后因为他们掩饰真相而错过了前期疫情防御宝贵的时间: 1
		从凌晨2: 1
		00突如其来的: 1
		封城令: 1
		没有任何预兆和补充说明: 1
		900万人在那一刻开始感到慌张: 1
		于是出现了凌晨3: 1
		00大家抢购24小时便利店: 1
		一大早去超市抢购的景象: 1
		包括我在内: 1
		我们想尽一切办法想要离开武汉: 1
		但是我们发现这个笼子早已经被上了锁: 1
		新年第一天: 1
		那天我看着春节联欢晚会上的盛景: 1
		看着朋友从医院传回的景象: 1
		看着桌上因为食材短缺凑出了4个菜: 1
		我逼着我自己记住他们如何把我的新年变成了一场噩梦: 1
		在新年的第二天: 1
		又是突如其来的一道禁令: 1
		通知我们所有的武汉人不允许开车上街: 1
		结果这道政令只存活了不到6个小时: 1
		甚至都没有实施: 1
		原因很简单: 1
		他们需要保证医务工作人员的出行: 1
		老人孕妇的看病: 1
		居民的采买需求: 1
		以及运送病人: 1
		这些车辆全部是需要市民自发组织: 1
		已必须得取得证明: 1
		在大家的声讨声中: 1
		他们才放弃了这套愚蠢的政策: 1
		政府下达的其他政策反应出来则是工作上的混乱: 1
		甚至传出来了武汉市第一医院医务人员的饭都没有办法保证: 1
		需要我们捐大米和油: 1
		他们一方面宣扬我们的人民是多么善良: 1
		另外一方面如往常一样绝口不提我们是纳税人: 1
		如此的政府还有什么存在的必要呢: 1
		我朋友是一名共产党员: 1
		他加入这个党唯一的目的就是希望能够得到好处: 1
		成为特权阶级: 1
		他的母亲被要求必须得去医院的一线: 1
		于是在除夕夜的当天: 1
		他哭着跟我说: 1
		他一定要离开这个地方: 1
		因为这个地方对他母亲太差了: 1
		不给防护要医生们去送死: 1
		很多人可能不能理解为什么医生不会罢工: 1
		是因为他们被通知: 1
		如果敢罢工: 1
		会被取消执照并且影响家人的工作: 1
		于是这帮医生们在没有任何防护的情况下工作: 1
		武汉的经历就像当你的家着火的时候: 1
		周围所有的邻居都看到了: 1
		然而却要求你不要从窗户逃出来: 1
		只有当大火失去控制: 1
		当整个城市被烈焰覆盖: 1
		他们才会慢慢地为自己的行为负责: 1
		并且一边帮忙一边要让世人知道自己的壮举: 1
		并不是所有人都生来拥有平等的待遇和权利: 1
		我之所以能够保留下来口罩: 1
		只是因为我会翻墙: 1
		95: 1
		00后年轻一代对举国体: 1
		制和集体主义有着与生俱来的好感: 1
		因为他们亲历了大国崛起的红利时期: 1
		也还没机会吃过任何瘪: 1
		这几天的事情: 1
		让有些小孩子大吃一鲸: 1
		有个男生最早在微博上骂别人造谣: 1
		不相信国家还能相信什么: 1
		结果自己的亲人感染后没法入院: 1
		事不关己才变成了咒骂和求救: 1
		有学生昨天刚在李文亮的浪潮中表态: 1
		害死他的只是病毒: 1
		一切要以疫情为重: 1
		但后来发现自己的宿舍被无条件无通知征用做隔离房: 1
		马上心态就崩掉了: 1
		这是社会给年轻人的第一课: 1
		当有人说出我们可以为了某个目标: 1
		不惜一切代价: 1
		这句话时: 1
		别急着鼓掌: 1
		也许有一天: 1
		你就是代价之一: 1
		在当下这个新冠肺炎横行的时代: 1
		这一句老话被赋予了新的含义: 1
		当棍子打到自己头上时: 1
		知道了疼: 1
		也终于理解了当年别人为什么会喊疼: 1
		在中国我们才可以10天修起医院: 1
		我们才可以动员这么多人投入到防治事业里: 1
		我们才可以立马封掉一座900万的城市: 1
		这群人类已经丧失了最基本的思考: 1
		因为他们不明白: 1
		如果有人权民主和自由: 1
		早在一个月之前: 1
		我们就会知道武汉发生了什么: 1
		不会让第一个吹哨人白白的送死: 1

		一位武汉的居民: 1
		编者注: 1
		出于担心中国政府会因为其批评而实施报复: 1
		本篇文章的作者要求匿名投稿: 1
		中国武汉的政府封锁令已经清空了这座城市的街道: 1
		作为一名武汉人: 1
		我和我的家人正活在地狱中: 1
		马上封城接近一个月: 1
		每天晚上睡觉之前: 1
		我还是有一种不真实感: 1
		现在的这个人间地狱到底是怎么造成的: 1
		我在中国生活了快30年: 1
		我和我的家人一直努力想要拥有更好的生活: 1
		我们告诉自己再努力一点就能成为中产阶级: 1
		可是随后的生活并没有如我的愿: 1
		从小我就努力的学习: 1
		考上了中国最棒的新闻专业: 1
		我的梦想是当一名记者: 1
		可是当我发现我因为政府管制实现我梦想的时候: 1
		我选择了放弃: 1
		我以为这样就能换来安稳的生活: 1
		因为我不断的告诉自己: 1
		我通过辛勤的工作为为他们缴纳高昂的税款并且不发表任何关于政治的言论: 1
		那么我就是安全的: 1
		我不会成为少数的倒霉蛋: 1
		直到今天我发现: 1
		这是幻梦: 1
		原来成为倒霉蛋是不需要理由的: 1
		在目前的政治体制以内: 1
		没有言论自由: 1
		就没有安稳生活: 1
		在封城的那一刻: 1
		我也满怀希望这个号称: 1
		集中办大事: 1
		的极端政体能够在故意隐瞒导致错过防控最佳期对武汉人民进行补救: 1
		可惜我又一次感到了绝望: 1
		早在12月初就已经有患者到医院就诊: 1
		不知出于何种理由他们一直没有对外公布: 1
		也没有采取任何的有效措施: 1
		最后因为他们掩饰真相而错过了前期疫情防御宝贵的时间: 1
		从凌晨2: 1
		00突如其来的: 1
		封城令: 1
		没有任何预兆和补充说明: 1
		900万人在那一刻开始感到慌张: 1
		于是出现了凌晨3: 1
		00大家抢购24小时便利店: 1
		一大早去超市抢购的景象: 1
		包括我在内: 1
		我们想尽一切办法想要离开武汉: 1
		但是我们发现这个笼子早已经被上了锁: 1
		新年第一天: 1
		那天我看着春节联欢晚会上的盛景: 1
		看着朋友从医院传回的景象: 1
		看着桌上因为食材短缺凑出了4个菜: 1
		我逼着我自己记住他们如何把我的新年变成了一场噩梦: 1
		在新年的第二天: 1
		又是突如其来的一道禁令: 1
		通知我们所有的武汉人不允许开车上街: 1
		结果这道政令只存活了不到6个小时: 1
		甚至都没有实施: 1
		原因很简单: 1
		他们需要保证医务工作人员的出行: 1
		老人孕妇的看病: 1
		居民的采买需求: 1
		以及运送病人: 1
		这些车辆全部是需要市民自发组织: 1
		已必须得取得证明: 1
		在大家的声讨声中: 1
		他们才放弃了这套愚蠢的政策: 1
		政府下达的其他政策反应出来则是工作上的混乱: 1
		甚至传出来了武汉市第一医院医务人员的饭都没有办法保证: 1
		需要我们捐大米和油: 1
		他们一方面宣扬我们的人民是多么善良: 1
		另外一方面如往常一样绝口不提我们是纳税人: 1
		如此的政府还有什么存在的必要呢: 1
		我朋友是一名共产党员: 1
		他加入这个党唯一的目的就是希望能够得到好处: 1
		成为特权阶级: 1
		他的母亲被要求必须得去医院的一线: 1
		于是在除夕夜的当天: 1
		他哭着跟我说: 1
		他一定要离开这个地方: 1
		因为这个地方对他母亲太差了: 1
		不给防护要医生们去送死: 1
		很多人可能不能理解为什么医生不会罢工: 1
		是因为他们被通知: 1
		如果敢罢工: 1
		会被取消执照并且影响家人的工作: 1
		于是这帮医生们在没有任何防护的情况下工作: 1
		武汉的经历就像当你的家着火的时候: 1
		周围所有的邻居都看到了: 1
		然而却要求你不要从窗户逃出来: 1
		只有当大火失去控制: 1
		当整个城市被烈焰覆盖: 1
		他们才会慢慢地为自己的行为负责: 1
		并且一边帮忙一边要让世人知道自己的壮举: 1
		并不是所有人都生来拥有平等的待遇和权利: 1
		我之所以能够保留下来口罩: 1
		只是因为我会翻墙: 1
		00后年轻一代对举国体: 1
		制和集体主义有着与生俱来的好感: 1
		因为他们亲历了大国崛起的红利时期: 1
		也还没机会吃过任何瘪: 1
		这几天的事情: 1
		让有些小孩子大吃一鲸: 1
		有个男生最早在微博上骂别人造谣: 1
		不相信国家还能相信什么: 1
		结果自己的亲人感染后没法入院: 1
		事不关己才变成了咒骂和求救: 1
		有学生昨天刚在李文亮的浪潮中表态: 1
		害死他的只是病毒: 1
		一切要以疫情为重: 1
		但后来发现自己的宿舍被无条件无通知征用做隔离房: 1
		马上心态就崩掉了: 1
		这是社会给年轻人的第一课: 1
		当有人说出我们可以为了某个目标: 1
		不惜一切代价: 1
		这句话时: 1
		别急着鼓掌: 1
		也许有一天: 1
		你就是代价之一: 1
		在当下这个新冠肺炎横行的时代: 1
		这一句老话被赋予了新的含义: 1
		当棍子打到自己头上时: 1
		知道了疼: 1
		也终于理解了当年别人为什么会喊疼: 1
		在中国我们才可以10天修起医院: 1
		我们才可以动员这么多人投入到防治事业里: 1
		我们才可以立马封掉一座900万的城市: 1
		这群人类已经丧失了最基本的思考: 1
		因为他们不明白: 1
		如果有人权民主和自由: 1
		早在一个月之前: 1
		我们就会知道武汉发生了什么: 1
		不会让第一个吹哨人白白的送死: 1

		一位武汉的居民: 1
		编者注: 1
		出于担心中国政府会因为其批评而实施报复: 1
		本篇文章的作者要求匿名投稿: 1
		中国武汉的政府封锁令已经清空了这座城市的街道: 1
		作为一名武汉人: 1
		我和我的家人正活在地狱中: 1
		马上封城接近一个月: 1
		每天晚上睡觉之前: 1
		我还是有一种不真实感: 1
		现在的这个人间地狱到底是怎么造成的: 1
		我在中国生活了快30年: 1
		我和我的家人一直努力想要拥有更好的生活: 1
		我们告诉自己再努力一点就能成为中产阶级: 1
		可是随后的生活并没有如我的愿: 1
		从小我就努力的学习: 1
		考上了中国最棒的新闻专业: 1
		我的梦想是当一名记者: 1
		可是当我发现我因为政府管制实现我梦想的时候: 1
		我选择了放弃: 1
		我以为这样就能换来安稳的生活: 1
		因为我不断的告诉自己: 1
		我通过辛勤的工作为为他们缴纳高昂的税款并且不发表任何关于政治的言论: 1
		那么我就是安全的: 1
		我不会成为少数的倒霉蛋: 1
		直到今天我发现: 1
		这是幻梦: 1
		原来成为倒霉蛋是不需要理由的: 1
		在目前的政治体制以内: 1
		没有言论自由: 1
		就没有安稳生活: 1
		在封城的那一刻: 1
		我也满怀希望这个号称: 1
		集中办大事: 1
		的极端政体能够在故意隐瞒导致错过防控最佳期对武汉人民进行补救: 1
		可惜我又一次感到了绝望: 1
		早在12月初就已经有患者到医院就诊: 1
		不知出于何种理由他们一直没有对外公布: 1
		也没有采取任何的有效措施: 1
		最后因为他们掩饰真相而错过了前期疫情防御宝贵的时间: 1
		从凌晨2: 1
		00突如其来的: 1
		封城令: 1
		没有任何预兆和补充说明: 1
		900万人在那一刻开始感到慌张: 1
		于是出现了凌晨3: 1
		00大家抢购24小时便利店: 1
		一大早去超市抢购的景象: 1
		包括我在内: 1
		我们想尽一切办法想要离开武汉: 1
		但是我们发现这个笼子早已经被上了锁: 1
		新年第一天: 1
		那天我看着春节联欢晚会上的盛景: 1
		看着朋友从医院传回的景象: 1
		看着桌上因为食材短缺凑出了4个菜: 1
		我逼着我自己记住他们如何把我的新年变成了一场噩梦: 1
		在新年的第二天: 1
		又是突如其来的一道禁令: 1
		通知我们所有的武汉人不允许开车上街: 1
		结果这道政令只存活了不到6个小时: 1
		甚至都没有实施: 1
		原因很简单: 1
		他们需要保证医务工作人员的出行: 1
		老人孕妇的看病: 1
		居民的采买需求: 1
		以及运送病人: 1
		这些车辆全部是需要市民自发组织: 1
		已必须得取得证明: 1
		在大家的声讨声中: 1
		他们才放弃了这套愚蠢的政策: 1
		政府下达的其他政策反应出来则是工作上的混乱: 1
		甚至传出来了武汉市第一医院医务人员的饭都没有办法保证: 1
		需要我们捐大米和油: 1
		他们一方面宣扬我们的人民是多么善良: 1
		另外一方面如往常一样绝口不提我们是纳税人: 1
		如此的政府还有什么存在的必要呢: 1
		我朋友是一名共产党员: 1
		他加入这个党唯一的目的就是希望能够得到好处: 1
		成为特权阶级: 1
		他的母亲被要求必须得去医院的一线: 1
		于是在除夕夜的当天: 1
		他哭着跟我说: 1
		他一定要离开这个地方: 1
		因为这个地方对他母亲太差了: 1
		不给防护要医生们去送死: 1
		很多人可能不能理解为什么医生不会罢工: 1
		是因为他们被通知: 1
		如果敢罢工: 1
		会被取消执照并且影响家人的工作: 1
		于是这帮医生们在没有任何防护的情况下工作: 1
		武汉的经历就像当你的家着火的时候: 1
		周围所有的邻居都看到了: 1
		然而却要求你不要从窗户逃出来: 1
		只有当大火失去控制: 1
		当整个城市被烈焰覆盖: 1
		他们才会慢慢地为自己的行为负责: 1
		并且一边帮忙一边要让世人知道自己的壮举: 1
		并不是所有人都生来拥有平等的待遇和权利: 1
		我之所以能够保留下来口罩: 1
		只是因为我会翻墙: 1
		00后年轻一代对举国体: 1
		制和集体主义有着与生俱来的好感: 1
		因为他们亲历了大国崛起的红利时期: 1
		也还没机会吃过任何瘪: 1
		这几天的事情: 1
		让有些小孩子大吃一鲸: 1
		有个男生最早在微博上骂别人造谣: 1
		不相信国家还能相信什么: 1
		结果自己的亲人感染后没法入院: 1
		事不关己才变成了咒骂和求救: 1
		有学生昨天刚在李文亮的浪潮中表态: 1
		害死他的只是病毒: 1
		一切要以疫情为重: 1
		但后来发现自己的宿舍被无条件无通知征用做隔离房: 1
		马上心态就崩掉了: 1
		这是社会给年轻人的第一课: 1
		当有人说出我们可以为了某个目标: 1
		不惜一切代价: 1
		这句话时: 1
		别急着鼓掌: 1
		也许有一天: 1
		你就是代价之一: 1
		在当下这个新冠肺炎横行的时代: 1
		这一句老话被赋予了新的含义: 1
		当棍子打到自己头上时: 1
		知道了疼: 1
		也终于理解了当年别人为什么会喊疼: 1
		在中国我们才可以10天修起医院: 1
		我们才可以动员这么多人投入到防治事业里: 1
		我们才可以立马封掉一座900万的城市: 1
		这群人类已经丧失了最基本的思考: 1
		因为他们不明白: 1
		如果有人权民主和自由: 1
		早在一个月之前: 1
		我们就会知道武汉发生了什么: 1
		不会让第一个吹哨人白白的送死: 1
