The final report file should be a text document. The Master Report Header should be as follows:

Lexical Frequency Report

The sections following this header should be the subject and article data.

Each Source report will begin with the following header

Each News Source will be separated into the subjects described in the previous document, and the subjects labeled as follows:

[Subject] Article Statistics

Where Subject is the name of the subject where the articles came from. 

This section will contain the individual article report statistics.

The article information will be written as follows:


Article Name

[TAB]Individual Word Count:
[TAB][TAB]word n: #

Where “[TAB]” stands for a hard TAB character, Article Total Word Count is the total number of words, whether repeated or not, in the article (not counting articles, titles or attribution data); Article Unique Word Count is the total number of unique words in the article, not counting repetitions (not counting articles, titles or attribution data); “n” is the cardinal number of an individual word in the list of words existing in the article, “#” is the number of occurrences of that word, and “...” specifies the remaining words in the list.

When all information for articles in a subject has been written, this section will be terminated with two line feeds, followed by an 79 character string of dashes (-).

The second section of the sub report will be labeled as follows:

Global Article Analysis, for subject [Subject]:


[TAB]Global Subject Total Word Count: X
[TAB]Global Subject Unique Word Count: X

[TAB][TAB]word n: #

Where “[TAB]” stands for a hard TAB character, Article Total Word Count is the total number of words, whether repeated or not, in the subject (not counting articles, titles or attribution data); Article Unique Word Count is the total number of unique words in the subject, not counting repetitions (not counting articles, titles or attribution data); “n” is the cardinal number of an individual word in the list of words existing in the subject(the number n itself is not to be printed) , “#” is the number of occurrences of that word, and “...” specifies the remaining words in the list.

When all information for global statistics in a source has been written, this section will be terminated with two line feeds, followed by an 79 character string of asterisks (*).



The final section of the sub report will be labeled as follows:

When all information for all news sources has been written, the file will be terminated with two line feeds, followed by two 79 character strings of equal signs (=), another line feed, and the following statement:

This signifies to any future program that this is the end of the data, and reading is to cease.
